# This script is a wrapper for git-gas-diff. See the README.md for more
# information about the tool.

# The script accepts zero, one or two commit hash arguments.
# If no commit is provided, the script will use git-gas-diff between the
# last merge commit and HEAD.
# If one commit is provided, the script will use git-gas-diff between this
# commit and HEAD.
# If two commits are provided, the script will use git-gas-diff between the
# first and the second.

# The script saves the git diff between the two commits to a temporary file
# that will be applied to git-gas-diff.
# The diff is restricted to regression test output files, does not consider
# added and deleted files (option `--diff-filter=ad`), and does not carry the
# context around modified lines (option `U0`).
