`git-gas-diff` is a tool that makes a synthesis of gas changes from a git diff on regression traces.

Compile with `make`.

Run with `dune exec git-gas-diff [file]`. [file] is optional; if absent, the standard input will be read.

Typical usage is to pipe a `git diff` with the tool:
```
git diff HEAD^ HEAD | dune exec git-gas-diff
```
if the top commit is an update of the gas for regression traces.

See `bin/main.ml` for more details.

Example of a run and its output:
```
