(*
[git-gas-diff] is a tool that outputs a synthesis of gas changes from a git
diff on regression traces.

Typical usage is to pipe a git diff that contains gas changes with the tool:
  git diff HEAD^ HEAD | dune exec git-gas-diff

The script reads a file (or the standard input if no file is provided) line by
line in the [run] function.
It ignores lines that do not start with '+' or '-', and the ones that start with
"+++" and "---".

Other lines (the ones that start with '+' or '-', but not "+++" nor "---") are
parsed by recognizing sub-strings (function [Stats.categorize]).
For instance, a line that contains "Estimated gas: " followed by a decimal
number [n] will be parsed into [Stat.Estimated n]. Whether the line is deleted
or added in the diff is also recognized.

The deleted lines are added in a queue. When an added line is found, it is
compared with the oldest line in the queue. If they match (meaning that they
concern the same kind of gas change; both lines contain "Estimated gas: " for
example), then the synthesis ([Synth.synth]) for this kind is updated
([Synths.update]).

The reason for a queue of deleted lines instead of just a single deleted line
is that [git diff] does not always produce a sequence of a deletion followed by
an addition. Indeed, we can also find several lines being deleted and then,
after this batch, the corresponding added lines.
