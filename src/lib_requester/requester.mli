(** Generic resource fetching/requesting service.

    This module defines a generic resource fetching service [Requester].
    It is parameterized by abstract services [Disk], [Request], [Memory_table]
    and [Precheck].

    It offers a key/value store interface. Values are looked up successively
    in [Memory_table.t], then in [Disk.store]. If not found, they are
    *requested* using the [Request] service. Ultimately, values are *cached* in
    the [Memory_table] for faster retrieval on subsequent queries. This is
    similar to a *read-through* cache except that values are never evicted
    from the [Memory_table].

    Internally, the service schedules requests to an abstract external
    source (e.g. network) for missing keys. The key is then *pending*
    and the caller waits for the value to be available.

    When a value is missing, the requester sends a request via
    [Request.send] to query a value to the network. The requester must be
    *notified* by an external component when the requested value is available
    using [Requester.notify].

    Notified values are validated before being inserted in the requester,
    using the [Precheck] module.

    The full resource fetching service is realized by the conjunction of
    two components. The requester component, defined by this library, and
    a notifying component (for instance, a worker thread waiting for network
    messages).

    The requester offers two interfaces. [FULL_REQUESTER] is the full
    view, which includes the creation, shutdown, and notification
    functions. It is to be used by the controller setting up the service,
    and the notifying component. [REQUESTER] is the restricted view, exported
    to the service final user. *)

module type REQUESTER = sig

  (** The index key *)
  type key

  (** The indexed data *)
  type value

  (** validation clue *)
  type param

  (** [know t k] returns true iff the key is present in the memory table or
      the disk. *)
  val known : t -> key -> bool Lwt.t

  type error += Missing_data of key

  type error += Canceled of key

  type error += Timeout of key

  (** Return value if it is found in-memory, or else on disk. Otherwise fail
      with error [Missing_data]. *)
  val read : t -> key -> value tzresult Lwt.t

  (** Same as [read] but returns [None] if not found. *)
  val read_opt : t -> key -> value option Lwt.t

  (** [fetch t ?peer ?timeout k param] returns the value when it is known.
      It can fail with [Timeout k] if [timeout] is provided and the value
      isn't know before the timeout expires. It can fail with [Cancel] if
      the request is canceled.

      The key is first looked up in memory, then on disk. If not present and
      not already requested, it schedules a request, and blocks until
      the requester is notified with [notify]. [param] is used to validate the
      notified value once it is received. (see also [PRECHECK] and [notify]).

      Requests are re-sent via a 1.5 exponential back-off, with initial
      delay set to [Request.initial_delay]. If the function
      is called multiple time with the same key but with distinct
      peers, the internal scheduler randomly chooses the requested
      peer (at each retry). *)

    ?peer:P2p_peer.Id.t ->
    ?timeout:Time.System.Span.t ->

  (** Remove the data from the memory table if present. Otherwise cancel all
      pending requests. Any pending [fetch] promises are resolved with the
      error [Canceled]. *)

      once. *)
  val watch : t -> (key * value) Lwt_stream.t * Lwt_watcher.stopper

  (** [inject t k v] returns [false] if [k] is already present in the memory
      table or in the disk, or has already been requested. Otherwise it
      updates the memory table and return [true] *)
  val inject : t -> key -> value -> bool Lwt.t

  (** [notify t peer k nv] notifies the requester that a value has been
      received for key [k], from peer [peer]. [nv] is a *notified value*. The
      notified value is validated using [Precheck.precheck], and the
      [param] provided at fetching time (see [PRECHECK]). If valid,
      the memory table is updated and all promises waiting on this key are
      resolved.

      If the key is not pending the notification is ignored. *)
  val notify : t -> P2p_peer.Id.t -> key -> notified_value -> unit Lwt.t

  (** [create ?random_table ?global_input r s] creates a requester. [r] is the
      configuration parameter passed to [Request] functions.

      The value for [random_table] determines whether the underlying hashtable
      randomises its hash (see {!Stdlib.Hashtbl.create} and specifically the
      documentation of the [random] parameter). The default depends on
      environment variables and {!Stdlib.Hashtbl.randomize} has been called. *)

(** When a requested value is received, it goes to a validation phase.

    At fetching time, the client gives a [param].
    At notification time, the client provides a [notified_value].
    [precheck] tries to construct a [value] from [param] and [notified_value].
