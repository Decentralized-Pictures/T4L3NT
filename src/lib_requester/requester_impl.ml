(** A helper to avoid having to use the full-fledged [Requester.Make]

 *  the underlying effects (see the [ref] in [Simple_request]) and hence
 *  want to pass their own instance.
 *
 *  Like {!Requester.Make}, this returns an instance of [FULL_REQUESTER].
 *  Note that, contrary to a production requester, the instance returned
 *  by this functor does not use the disk, it runs entirely in memory. *)
