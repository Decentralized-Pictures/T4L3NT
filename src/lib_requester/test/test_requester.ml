(** Testing
    -------
    Component:    Requester
    Invocation:   dune build @src/lib_requester/runtest
    Subject:      Basic behaviors of the API for generic resource
                  fetching/requesting service. Instantiating the [Requester]
                  functor with simple mocks.

                  [Memory_table] and [Disk_table] are hash tables from string
                  to int.
                  [Probe] either accepts or reject notified values based on
                  a boolean validation clue [Probe.param], regardless of
                  the key.
                  [Request] simply logs the requests made to [Request.send],
                  and considers only a unique, statically defined, active peer.
