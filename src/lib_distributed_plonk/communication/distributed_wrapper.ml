(** Wrapper for the Distributed library.
    The new API is designed for the distribution of protocols based on a
    1 master N workers architecture, in which at each step of the protocol:
    {ul
      {li
        The master asks all the workers to compute the same function over
        different inputs. We call these messages {e requests}. Each protocol
        step will define a [request] (see {Message} module), whose payload
        will change for every worker.}
      {li
        Each worker computes the {e reply} to the received request, and sends
        it back to the master. Each protocol step will define a [reply]
        (see {Message} module).
      }
      {li
        The master waits to receive all the replies from the workers.
      }
    }

    Instead of directly using the [send] and [receive], the new API provides
    two abstractions, `dmap` and `handle_request`, to implement this
    interaction from the master and worker respectively. These abstractions
    will enforce via the type-system that the [request] and [reply] used
    correspond to the same protocol step.

  Messages are refined into either a [request] or a [reply].
  Both these types are parameterized by their protocol [step].
  The ground type of messages ([t]) is enforced to be [bytes],
  to avoid relying on the Marshalling performed by the Distributed library.
