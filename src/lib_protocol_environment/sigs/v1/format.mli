(** Pretty-printing.

    This module implements a pretty-printing facility to format values
    within {{!boxes}'pretty-printing boxes'} and {{!tags}'semantic tags'}
    combined with a set of {{!fpp}printf-like functions}.
    The pretty-printer splits lines at specified {{!breaks}break hints},
    and indents lines according to the box structure.
    Similarly, {{!tags}semantic tags} can be used to decouple text
    presentation from its contents.

    This pretty-printing facility is implemented as an overlay on top of
    abstract {{!section:formatter}formatters} which provide basic output
    functions.
    Some formatters are predefined, notably:
    - {!std_formatter} outputs to {{!Pervasives.stdout}stdout}
    - {!err_formatter} outputs to {{!Pervasives.stderr}stderr}

    Most functions in the {!Format} module come in two variants:
    a short version that operates on {!std_formatter} and the
    generic version prefixed by [pp_] that takes a formatter
    as its first argument.

    More formatters can be created with {!formatter_of_out_channel},
    {!formatter_of_buffer}, {!formatter_of_symbolic_output_buffer}
    or using {{!section:formatter}custom formatters}.

(** {1 Introduction}
    For a gentle introduction to the basics of pretty-printing using
    [Format], read
    {{:http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/guides/format.en.html}
    http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/guides/format.en.html}.

    You may consider this module as providing an extension to the
    [printf] facility to provide automatic line splitting. The addition of
    pretty-printing annotations to your regular [printf] format strings gives
    you fancy indentation and line breaks.
    Pretty-printing annotations are described below in the documentation of
    the function {!Format.fprintf}.

    You may also use the explicit pretty-printing box management and printing
    functions provided by this module. This style is more basic but more
    verbose than the concise [fprintf] format strings.

    For instance, the sequence
    [open_box 0; print_string "x ="; print_space ();
    print_int 1; close_box (); print_newline ()]
    that prints [x = 1] within a pretty-printing box, can be
    abbreviated as [printf "@[%s@ %i@]@." "x =" 1], or even shorter
    [printf "@[x =@ %i@]@." 1].

    Rule of thumb for casual users of this library:
    - use simple pretty-printing boxes (as obtained by [open_box 0]);
    - use simple break hints as obtained by [print_cut ()] that outputs a
    simple break hint, or by [print_space ()] that outputs a space
    indicating a break hint;
    - once a pretty-printing box is open, display its material with basic
    printing functions (e. g. [print_int] and [print_string]);
    - when the material for a pretty-printing box has been printed, call
    [close_box ()] to close the box;
    - at the end of pretty-printing, flush the pretty-printer to display all
    the remaining material, e.g. evaluate [print_newline ()].

    The behavior of pretty-printing commands is unspecified
    if there is no open pretty-printing box. Each box opened by
    one of the [open_] functions below must be closed using [close_box]
    for proper formatting. Otherwise, some of the material printed in the
    boxes may not be output, or may be formatted incorrectly.

    In case of interactive use, each phrase is executed in the initial state
    of the standard pretty-printer: after each phrase execution, the
    interactive system closes all open pretty-printing boxes, flushes all
    pending text, and resets the standard pretty-printer.

    Warning: mixing calls to pretty-printing functions of this module with
    calls to {!Pervasives} low level output functions is error prone.

    The pretty-printing functions output material that is delayed in the
    pretty-printer queue and stacks in order to compute proper line
    splitting. In contrast, basic I/O output functions write directly in
    their output device. As a consequence, the output of a basic I/O function
    may appear before the output of a pretty-printing function that has been
    called before. For instance,
    [
    Pervasives.print_string "<";
    Format.print_string "PRETTY";
    Pervasives.print_string ">";
    Format.print_string "TEXT";
    ]
    leads to output [<>PRETTYTEXT].

    formatter) and all its machinery. See also {!section:formatter}. *)

(** {1:boxes Pretty-printing boxes} *)

(** The pretty-printing engine uses the concepts of pretty-printing box and
    break hint to drive indentation and line splitting behavior of the
    pretty-printer.

    Each different pretty-printing box kind introduces a specific line splitting
    policy:

    - within an {e horizontal} box, break hints never split the line (but the
    line may be split in a box nested deeper),
    - within a {e vertical} box, break hints always split the line,
    - within an {e horizontal/vertical} box, if the box fits on the current line
    then break hints never split the line, otherwise break hint always split
    the line,
    - within a {e compacting} box, a break hint never splits the line,
    unless there is no more room on the current line.

    Note that line splitting policy is box specific: the policy of a box does
    not rule the policy of inner boxes. For instance, if a vertical box is
    nested in an horizontal box, all break hints within the vertical box will
    split the line.
*)

(** [pp_open_box ppf d] opens a new compacting pretty-printing box with
    offset [d] in the formatter [ppf].

    Within this box, the pretty-printer prints as much as possible material on
    every line.

    A break hint splits the line if there is no more room on the line to
    print the remainder of the box.

    Within this box, the pretty-printer emphasizes the box structure: a break
    hint also splits the line if the splitting ``moves to the left''
    (i.e. the new line gets an indentation smaller than the one of the current
    line).

    This box is the general purpose pretty-printing box.

    If the pretty-printer splits the line in the box, offset [d] is added to
    the current indentation.

(** [pp_open_hbox ppf ()] opens a new 'horizontal' pretty-printing box.

    This box prints material on a single line.

    Break hints in a horizontal box never split the line.
    (Line splitting may still occur inside boxes nested deeper).
*)
val pp_open_hbox : formatter -> unit -> unit

(** [pp_open_vbox ppf d] opens a new 'vertical' pretty-printing box
    with offset [d].

    This box prints material on as many lines as break hints in the box.

    Every break hint in a vertical box splits the line.

    If the pretty-printer splits the line in the box, [d] is added to the
    current indentation.
*)
val pp_open_vbox : formatter -> int -> unit

(** [pp_open_hvbox ppf d] opens a new 'horizontal/vertical' pretty-printing box
    with offset [d].

    This box behaves as an horizontal box if it fits on a single line,
    otherwise it behaves as a vertical box.

    If the pretty-printer splits the line in the box, [d] is added to the
    current indentation.
*)
val pp_open_hvbox : formatter -> int -> unit

(** [pp_open_hovbox ppf d] opens a new 'horizontal-or-vertical'
    pretty-printing box with offset [d].

    This box prints material as much as possible on every line.

    A break hint splits the line if there is no more room on the line to
    print the remainder of the box.

    If the pretty-printer splits the line in the box, [d] is added to the
    current indentation.

val pp_print_string : formatter -> string -> unit

(** [pp_print_as ppf len s] prints [s] in the current pretty-printing box.
    The pretty-printer formats [s] as if it were of length [len].

(** Print a boolean in the current pretty-printing box. *)
val pp_print_bool : formatter -> bool -> unit

(** {1:breaks Break hints} *)

(** A 'break hint' tells the pretty-printer to output some space or split the
    line whichever way is more appropriate to the current pretty-printing box
    splitting rules.

    Break hints are used to separate printing items and are mandatory to let
    the pretty-printer correctly split lines and indent items.

    Simple break hints are:
    - the 'space': output a space or split the line if appropriate,
    - the 'cut': split the line if appropriate.

    Note: the notions of space and line splitting are abstract for the
    pretty-printing engine, since those notions can be completely redefined
    by the programmer.
    However, in the pretty-printer default setting, ``output a space'' simply
    means printing a space character (ASCII code 32) and ``split the line''
    means printing a newline character (ASCII code 10).
*)

(** [pp_print_space ppf ()] emits a 'space' break hint:
    the pretty-printer may split the line at this point,
    otherwise it prints one space.

    [pp_print_space ppf ()] is equivalent to [pp_print_break ppf 1 0].
*)
val pp_print_space : formatter -> unit -> unit

(** [pp_print_cut ppf ()] emits a 'cut' break hint:
    the pretty-printer may split the line at this point,
    otherwise it prints nothing.

    [pp_print_cut ppf ()] is equivalent to [pp_print_break ppf 0 0].
*)
val pp_print_cut : formatter -> unit -> unit

(** [pp_print_break ppf nspaces offset] emits a 'full' break hint:
    the pretty-printer may split the line at this point,
    otherwise it prints [nspaces] spaces.

    If the pretty-printer splits the line, [offset] is added to
    the current indentation.
*)
val pp_print_break : formatter -> int -> int -> unit

(** Force a new line in the current pretty-printing box.

    The pretty-printer must split the line at this point,

    Not the normal way of pretty-printing, since imperative line splitting may
    interfere with current line counters and box size calculation.
    Using break hints within an enclosing vertical box is a better
    alternative.
*)
val pp_force_newline : formatter -> unit -> unit

(** Execute the next formatting command if the preceding line
    has just been split. Otherwise, ignore the next formatting
    command.
*)
val pp_print_if_newline : formatter -> unit -> unit

(** {1 Pretty-printing termination} *)

(** End of pretty-printing: resets the pretty-printer to initial state.

    All open pretty-printing boxes are closed, all pending text is printed.
    In addition, the pretty-printer low level output device is flushed to
    ensure that all pending text is really displayed.

    Note: never use [print_flush] in the normal course of a pretty-printing
    routine, since the pretty-printer uses a complex buffering machinery to
    properly indent the output; manually flushing those buffers at random
    would conflict with the pretty-printer strategy and result to poor
    rendering.

    Only consider using [print_flush] when displaying all pending material is
    mandatory (for instance in case of interactive use when you want the user
    to read some text) and when resetting the pretty-printer state will not
    disturb further pretty-printing.

    Warning: If the output device of the pretty-printer is an output channel,
    repeated calls to [print_flush] means repeated calls to {!Pervasives.flush}
    to flush the out channel; these explicit flush calls could foil the
    buffering strategy of output channels and could dramatically impact
    efficiency.
*)
val pp_print_flush : formatter -> unit -> unit

(** End of pretty-printing: resets the pretty-printer to initial state.

    All open pretty-printing boxes are closed, all pending text is printed.

    Equivalent to {!print_flush} followed by a new line.
    See corresponding words of caution for {!print_flush}.

    Note: this is not the normal way to output a new line;
    the preferred method is using break hints within a vertical pretty-printing
    box.
*)
val pp_print_newline : formatter -> unit -> unit

(** {1 Margin} *)

(** [pp_set_margin ppf d] sets the right margin to [d] (in characters):
    the pretty-printer splits lines that overflow the right margin according to
    the break hints given.
    Nothing happens if [d] is smaller than 2.
    If [d] is too large, the right margin is set to the maximum
    admissible value (which is greater than [10 ^ 9]).
    If [d] is less than the current maximum indentation limit, the
    maximum indentation limit is decreased while trying to preserve
    a minimal ratio [max_indent/margin>=50%] and if possible
    the current difference [margin - max_indent].
*)
val pp_set_margin : formatter -> int -> unit

(** Returns the position of the right margin. *)
val pp_get_margin : formatter -> unit -> int

(** {1 Maximum indentation limit} *)

(** [pp_set_max_indent ppf d] sets the maximum indentation limit of lines
    to [d] (in characters):
    once this limit is reached, new pretty-printing boxes are rejected to the
    left, if they do not fit on the current line.

    Nothing happens if [d] is smaller than 2.
    If [d] is too large, the limit is set to the maximum
    admissible value (which is greater than [10 ^ 9]).

    If [d] is greater or equal than the current margin, it is ignored,
    and the current maximum indentation limit is kept.
*)
val pp_set_max_indent : formatter -> int -> unit

(** Return the maximum indentation limit (in characters). *)
val pp_get_max_indent : formatter -> unit -> int

(** {1 Maximum formatting depth} *)

(** The maximum formatting depth is the maximum number of pretty-printing
    boxes simultaneously open.

    Material inside boxes nested deeper is printed as an ellipsis (more
    precisely as the text returned by {!get_ellipsis_text} [()]).
*)

(** [pp_set_max_boxes ppf max] sets the maximum number of pretty-printing
    boxes simultaneously open.

    Material inside boxes nested deeper is printed as an ellipsis (more
    precisely as the text returned by {!get_ellipsis_text} [()]).

    Nothing happens if [max] is smaller than 2.
*)
val pp_set_max_boxes : formatter -> int -> unit

(** Returns the maximum number of pretty-printing boxes allowed before
    ellipsis.
*)
val pp_get_max_boxes : formatter -> unit -> int

(** Tests if the maximum number of pretty-printing boxes allowed have already
    been opened.
*)
val pp_over_max_boxes : formatter -> unit -> bool

(** {1 Tabulation boxes} *)

(**

   A {e tabulation box} prints material on lines divided into cells of fixed
   length. A tabulation box provides a simple way to display vertical columns
   of left adjusted text.

   This box features command [set_tab] to define cell boundaries, and command
   [print_tab] to move from cell to cell and split the line when there is no
   more cells to print on the line.

   Note: printing within tabulation box is line directed, so arbitrary line
   splitting inside a tabulation box leads to poor rendering. Yet, controlled
   use of tabulation boxes allows simple printing of columns within
   module {!Format}.
*)

(** [open_tbox ()] opens a new tabulation box.

    This box prints lines separated into cells of fixed width.

    Inside a tabulation box, special {e tabulation markers} defines points of
    interest on the line (for instance to delimit cell boundaries).
    Function {!Format.set_tab} sets a tabulation marker at insertion point.

    A tabulation box features specific {e tabulation breaks} to move to next
    tabulation marker or split the line. Function {!Format.print_tbreak} prints
    a tabulation break.
*)
val pp_open_tbox : formatter -> unit -> unit

(** Closes the most recently opened tabulation box. *)
val pp_close_tbox : formatter -> unit -> unit

(** Sets a tabulation marker at current insertion point. *)
val pp_set_tab : formatter -> unit -> unit

(** [print_tab ()] emits a 'next' tabulation break hint: if not already set on
    a tabulation marker, the insertion point moves to the first tabulation
    marker on the right, or the pretty-printer splits the line and insertion
    point moves to the leftmost tabulation marker.

    It is equivalent to [print_tbreak 0 0]. *)
val pp_print_tab : formatter -> unit -> unit

(** [print_tbreak nspaces offset] emits a 'full' tabulation break hint.

    If not already set on a tabulation marker, the insertion point moves to the
    first tabulation marker on the right and the pretty-printer prints
    [nspaces] spaces.

    If there is no next tabulation marker on the right, the pretty-printer
    splits the line at this point, then insertion point moves to the leftmost
    tabulation marker of the box.

    If the pretty-printer splits the line, [offset] is added to
    the current indentation.
*)
val pp_print_tbreak : formatter -> int -> int -> unit

(** {1 Ellipsis} *)

(** Set the text of the ellipsis printed when too many pretty-printing boxes
    are open (a single dot, [.], by default).
*)
val pp_set_ellipsis_text : formatter -> string -> unit

(** Return the text of the ellipsis. *)
val pp_get_ellipsis_text : formatter -> unit -> string

(** {1:tags Semantic tags} *)

type tag = string

(** {i Semantic tags} (or simply {e tags}) are user's defined delimiters
    to associate user's specific operations to printed entities.

    Common usage of semantic tags is text decoration to get specific font or
    text size rendering for a display device, or marking delimitation of
    entities (e.g. HTML or TeX elements or terminal escape sequences).
    More sophisticated usage of semantic tags could handle dynamic
    modification of the pretty-printer behavior to properly print the material
    within some specific tags.

    In order to properly delimit printed entities, a semantic tag must be
    opened before and closed after the entity. Semantic tags must be properly
    nested like parentheses.

    Tag specific operations occur any time a tag is opened or closed, At each
    occurrence, two kinds of operations are performed {e tag-marking} and
    {e tag-printing}:
    - The tag-marking operation is the simpler tag specific operation: it simply
    writes a tag specific string into the output device of the
    formatter. Tag-marking does not interfere with line-splitting computation.
    - The tag-printing operation is the more involved tag specific operation: it
    can print arbitrary material to the formatter. Tag-printing is tightly
    linked to the current pretty-printer operations.

    Roughly speaking, tag-marking is commonly used to get a better rendering of
    texts in the rendering device, while tag-printing allows fine tuning of
    printing routines to print the same entity differently according to the
    semantic tags (i.e. print additional material or even omit parts of the
    output).

    More precisely: when a semantic tag is opened or closed then both and
    successive 'tag-printing' and 'tag-marking' operations occur:
    - Tag-printing a semantic tag means calling the formatter specific function
    [print_open_tag] (resp. [print_close_tag]) with the name of the tag as
    argument: that tag-printing function can then print any regular material
    to the formatter (so that this material is enqueued as usual in the
    formatter queue for further line splitting computation).
    - Tag-marking a semantic tag means calling the formatter specific function
    [mark_open_tag] (resp. [mark_close_tag]) with the name of the tag as
    argument: that tag-marking function can then return the 'tag-opening
    marker' (resp. `tag-closing marker') for direct output into the output
    device of the formatter.

    Being written directly into the output device of the formatter, semantic
    tag marker strings are not considered as part of the printing material that
    drives line splitting (in other words, the length of the strings
    corresponding to tag markers is considered as zero for line splitting).

    Thus, semantic tag handling is in some sense transparent to pretty-printing
    and does not interfere with usual indentation. Hence, a single
    pretty-printing routine can output both simple 'verbatim' material or
    richer decorated output depending on the treatment of tags. By default,
    tags are not active, hence the output is not decorated with tag
    information. Once [set_tags] is set to [true], the pretty-printer engine
    honors tags and decorates the output accordingly.

    Default tag-marking functions behave the HTML way: tags are enclosed in "<"
    and ">"; hence, opening marker for tag [t] is ["<t>"] and closing marker is
    ["</t>"].

    Default tag-printing functions just do nothing.

    Tag-marking and tag-printing functions are user definable and can
    be set by calling {!set_formatter_tag_functions}.

    Semantic tag operations may be set on or off with {!set_tags}.
    Tag-marking operations may be set on or off with {!set_mark_tags}.
    Tag-printing operations may be set on or off with {!set_print_tags}.

(** [fprintf ff fmt arg1 ... argN] formats the arguments [arg1] to [argN]

    The format string [fmt] is a character string which contains three types of
    objects: plain characters and conversion specifications as specified in

    The pretty-printing indication characters are introduced by

    - [@\[]: open a pretty-printing box. The type and offset of the
    box may be optionally specified with the following syntax:
    the [<] character, followed by an optional box type indication,
    then an optional integer offset, and the closing [>] character.
    Pretty-printing box type is one of [h], [v], [hv], [b], or [hov].
    '[h]' stands for an 'horizontal' pretty-printing box,
    '[v]' stands for a 'vertical' pretty-printing box,
    '[hv]' stands for an 'horizontal/vertical' pretty-printing box,
    '[b]' stands for an 'horizontal-or-vertical' pretty-printing box
    demonstrating indentation,
    '[hov]' stands a simple 'horizontal-or-vertical' pretty-printing box.
    For instance, [@\[<hov 2>] opens an 'horizontal-or-vertical'
    pretty-printing box with indentation 2 as obtained with [open_hovbox 2].
    For more details about pretty-printing boxes, see the various box opening
    functions [open_*box].
    - [@\]]: close the most recently opened pretty-printing box.
    - [@,]: output a 'cut' break hint, as with [print_cut ()].
    - [@ ]: output a 'space' break hint, as with [print_space ()].
    - [@;]: output a 'full' break hint as with [print_break]. The
    [nspaces] and [offset] parameters of the break hint may be
    optionally specified with the following syntax:
    the [<] character, followed by an integer [nspaces] value,
    then an integer [offset], and a closing [>] character.
    If no parameters are provided, the good break defaults to a
    'space' break hint.
    - [@.]: flush the pretty-printer and split the line, as with
    [print_newline ()].
    - [@<n>]: print the following item as if it were of length [n].
    Hence, [printf "@<0>%s" arg] prints [arg] as a zero length string.
    If [@<n>] is not followed by a conversion specification,
    then the following character of the format is printed as if
    it were of length [n].
    - [@\{]: open a semantic tag. The name of the tag may be optionally
    specified with the following syntax:
    the [<] character, followed by an optional string
    specification, and the closing [>] character. The string
    specification is any character string that does not contain the
    closing character ['>']. If omitted, the tag name defaults to the
    empty string.
    For more details about semantic tags, see the functions {!open_tag} and
    {!close_tag}.
    - [@\}]: close the most recently opened semantic tag.
    - [@?]: flush the pretty-printer as with [print_flush ()].
    This is equivalent to the conversion [%!].
    - [@\n]: force a newline, as with [force_newline ()], not the normal way
    of pretty-printing, you should prefer using break hints inside a vertical
    pretty-printing box.

    Note: To prevent the interpretation of a [@] character as a
    pretty-printing indication, escape it with a [%] character.
    Old quotation mode [@@] is deprecated since it is not compatible with
    formatted input interpretation of character ['@'].

    Example: [printf "@[%s@ %d@]@." "x =" 1] is equivalent to
    [open_box (); print_string "x ="; print_space ();
    print_int 1; close_box (); print_newline ()].
    It prints [x = 1] within a pretty-printing 'horizontal-or-vertical' box.

(** Same as [printf] above, but instead of printing on a formatter,
    returns a string containing the result of formatting the arguments.
    Note that the pretty-printer queue is flushed at the end of {e each
    call} to [sprintf].

    In case of multiple and related calls to [sprintf] to output
    material on a single string, you should consider using [fprintf]
    with the predefined formatter [str_formatter] and call
    [flush_str_formatter ()] to get the final result.

    Alternatively, you can use [Format.fprintf] with a formatter writing to a
    buffer of your own: flushing the formatter and the buffer at the end of
    pretty-printing returns the desired string.
