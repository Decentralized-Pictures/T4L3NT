(** The initially opened module.

    This module provides the basic operations over the built-in types
    (numbers, booleans, byte sequences, strings, exceptions, references,
    lists, arrays, input-output channels, ...).

    This module is automatically opened at the beginning of each compilation.
    All components of this module can therefore be referred by their short
    name, without prefixing them by [Pervasives].

    less than or equal to the real quotient of [x] by [y].  Moreover,

    The result is unspecified if [m < 0] or [m >= bitsize],
    where [bitsize] is [32] on a 32-bit platform and
    [64] on a 64-bit platform.
    Right-associative operator at precedence level 8/11. *)
external ( lsl ) : int -> int -> int = "%lslint"

    Right-associative operator at precedence level 8/11. *)
external ( lsr ) : int -> int -> int = "%lsrint"

(** [n asr m] shifts [n] to the right by [m] bits.

(** Return the character with the given ASCII code.
    Raise [Invalid_argument "char_of_int"] if the argument is
    outside the range 0--255. *)
val char_of_int : int -> char

(** {1 Unit operations} *)

(** Discard the value of its argument and return [()].
    For instance, [ignore(f x)] discards the result of
    the side-effecting function [f].  It is equivalent to
    [f x; ()], except that the latter may generate a
    compiler warning; writing [ignore(f x)] instead
    avoids the warning. *)
external ignore : 'a -> unit = "%ignore"

(** {1 String conversion functions} *)

(** Return the string representation of a boolean. As the returned values
    may be shared, the user should not modify them directly.
*)

(** Convert the given string to a boolean.
    Return [None] if the string is not
    ["true"] or ["false"].
    @since 4.05
*)
val bool_of_string_opt : string -> bool option

(** Return the string representation of an integer, in decimal. *)
val string_of_int : int -> string

(** Convert the given string to an integer.
    The string is read in decimal (by default, or if the string
    begins with [0u]), in hexadecimal (if it begins with [0x] or
    [0X]), in octal (if it begins with [0o] or [0O]), or in binary
    (if it begins with [0b] or [0B]).

    The [0u] prefix reads the input as an unsigned integer in the range
    [[0, 2*max_int+1]].  If the input exceeds {!max_int}
    it is converted to the signed integer
    [min_int + input - max_int - 1].

    The [_] (underscore) character can appear anywhere in the string
    and is ignored.

    Return [None] if the given string is not a valid representation of
    an integer, or if the integer represented exceeds the range of
    integers representable in type [int].
    @since 4.05
*)

(** [r := a] stores the value of [a] in reference [r].
    Equivalent to [fun r v -> r.contents <- v].
    Right-associative operator at precedence level 1/11. *)
external ( := ) : 'a ref -> 'a -> unit = "%setfield0"

(** Increment the integer contained in the given reference.
    Equivalent to [fun r -> r := succ !r]. *)

    Equivalent to [fun r -> r := pred !r]. *)
external decr : int ref -> unit = "%decr"

(** {1 Result type} *)

(** @since 4.03.0 *)
type ('a, 'b) result = Ok of 'a | Error of 'b

(** {1 Operations on format strings} *)

(** Format strings are character strings with special lexical conventions
    that defines the functionality of formatted input/output functions. Format
    strings are used to read data with formatted input functions from module
    {!Scanf} and to print data with formatted output functions from modules
    {!Printf} and {!Format}.

    Format strings are made of three kinds of entities:
    - {e conversions specifications}, introduced by the special character ['%']
    followed by one or more characters specifying what kind of argument to
    read or print,
    - {e formatting indications}, introduced by the special character ['@']
    followed by one or more characters specifying how to read or print the
    argument,
    - {e plain characters} that are regular characters with usual lexical
    conventions. Plain characters specify string literals to be read in the
    input or printed in the output.

    There is an additional lexical rule to escape the special characters ['%']
    and ['@'] in format strings: if a special character follows a ['%']
    character, it is treated as a plain character. In other words, ["%%"] is
    considered as a plain ['%'] and ["%@"] as a plain ['@'].

    For more information about conversion specifications and formatting
    indications available, read the documentation of modules {!Scanf},
    {!Printf} and {!Format}.
*)

(** Format strings have a general and highly polymorphic type
    [('a, 'b, 'c, 'd, 'e, 'f) format6].
    The two simplified types, [format] and [format4] below are
    included for backward compatibility with earlier releases of
    OCaml.

    The meaning of format string type parameters is as follows:

    - ['a] is the type of the parameters of the format for formatted output
      functions ([printf]-style functions);
      ['a] is the type of the values read by the format for formatted input
      functions ([scanf]-style functions).

    - ['b] is the type of input source for formatted input functions and the
      type of output target for formatted output functions.
      For [printf]-style functions from module {!Printf}, ['b] is typically
      [out_channel];
      for [printf]-style functions from module {!Format}, ['b] is typically
      {!Format.formatter};
      for [scanf]-style functions from module {!Scanf}, ['b] is typically
      {!Scanf.Scanning.in_channel}.

      Type argument ['b] is also the type of the first argument given to
      user's defined printing functions for [%a] and [%t] conversions,
      and user's defined reading functions for [%r] conversion.

    - ['c] is the type of the result of the [%a] and [%t] printing
      functions, and also the type of the argument transmitted to the
      first argument of [kprintf]-style functions or to the
      [kscanf]-style functions.

    - ['d] is the type of parameters for the [scanf]-style functions.

    - ['e] is the type of the receiver function for the [scanf]-style functions.

    - ['f] is the final result type of a formatted input/output function
      invocation: for the [printf]-style functions, it is typically [unit];
      for the [scanf]-style functions, it is typically the result type of the
      receiver function.
