(** [Shell_context] is a persisting recursive map backed by an on-disk Irmin tree,
    i.e. {!Tezos_context.Context} (in [src/lib_context]), used
    by nodes. It is the "main" kind of context. It abstracts away
    {!Tezos_context.Context}, by hiding the internals, and making it
    an instance of the generic {!Protocol_environment.Context.t}.
    Other [*_context] modules of {!Tezos_protocol_environment}, i.e.
    siblings of this file, are backed by different type of values coming
    from {!Tezos_context}.

    [Shell_context] is one of the instances of {!Environment_context} along
    {!Memory_context} and {!Proxy_context}. All these 3 instances
    can implement the same API (i.e. {!Environment_context}), because
    this API is highly polymorphic, thanks to {!Environment_context.Context.ops}.

    As such, a {!Shell_context} value is an instance of {!Environment_context}
    whose [kind] is the one declared in this file.

    Instances of {!Shell_context} are harder to obtain than {!Memory_context} ones, because
    they require a dedicated folder on disk (the subdirectory [context]
    of the node's [--data-dir] when it runs). As such, instances of
    {!Shell_context} are harder to initialize and use than {!Memory_context};
    making them less amenable to testing for example. *)
