(** This module is the location where the proxy tweaks the behavior of a
    vanilla client. A regular mockup client uses a [Memory_context] in
    place of this implementation. Compared to [Memory_context], this
    instance features a [M.ProxyDelegate]
    which under the hood relies on [Proxy_getter].

    Whereas [Memory_context] is a regular recursive map, [Proxy_context]
    obtains values by delegating to endpoints when receiving requests.
    Hence, after right after having created an [empty] value with an instance
    of [M.ProxyDelegate], this value is as filled as the distant endpoint
    it delegates to. *)
