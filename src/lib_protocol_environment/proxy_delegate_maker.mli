(** [of_memory_tree t] creates a delegate that is backed by the tree [t].
    This is an alternative to delegating to a distant endpoint by doing RPCs
    (as done in the client, see e.g. [proto_alpha/lib_client/proxy.ml]).
    As delegates created by [of_memory_tree] are backed by an in-memory
    tree, they are as fast as they can be.

    This constructor is easier to use than {!of_memory_context}, because
    it requires only a tree of data; not a context. This constructor
    is typically useful for tests. *)
val of_memory_tree : Tezos_context_memory.Context.tree -> Proxy_delegate.t

(** [of_memory_context m] creates a delegate that is backed by the tree underlying [m].
    This is an alternative to delegating to a distant endpoint by doing RPCs
    (as done in the client, see e.g. [proto_alpha/lib_client/proxy.ml]).
    As delegates created by [of_memory_context] are backed by an in-memory
    tree, they are as fast as they can be.

    This constructor is slightly harder to use than {!of_memory_tree}, because
    it requires a full-fledged context instead of a tree (a context contains
    a tree, so a context is harder to obtain). *)
val of_memory_context : Tezos_context_memory.Context.t -> Proxy_delegate.t

(** [make_index context_path] creates an index that is suitable for being
    passed to {!of_index}. *)
val make_index : context_path:string -> Tezos_context.Context.index Lwt.t

(** [of_index index ctxt_hash] creates a delegate that checkouts the given
    index at the given [ctxt_hash]. It fails in the error monad if the hash is unknown.
    Otherwise it returns a delegate that queries the tree of data at this hash.

    This constructor is the hardest to use of all of this file, because
    to obtain an [index], you need a full-fledged context on disk. *)
