(** {1 A loggable batch of time measurements} *)

(** {b PLEASE, DO NOT DIRECTLY USE THIS MODULE BY YOURSELF
    IN YOUR OWN CODE. IT IS ONLY INTENDED TO BE USED THROUGH
    [Tezos_time_measurement_ppx] PPX REWRITERS FOR TESTING.}

    {b AN UNWISE USE COULD SEVERELY IMPACT THE MEMORY USAGE OF
    YOUR PROGRAM.} *)

(** This module offers several functionalities:
    - Measuring time of Ocaml expression execution.
    - Mesuring the current time just before executing an Ocaml
      expression.
    - Labelling these mesurements and storing them.
    - Logging all stored measurements as a batch. *)

module type S = sig
  (** [duration key thunk] mesures the time taken to run the
      given [thunk], binds the resulting time measurement
      with the given [key] and stores it in the batch. It will
      then evaluate in the result of the [thunk]. *)
  val duration : Measurement.key -> (unit -> 'a) -> 'a

  (** Same as [duration], but waits for the [thunk]'s resulting
      promise to be resolved in order to properly measure
      time when using Lwt. *)
  val duration_lwt : Measurement.key -> (unit -> 'a Lwt.t) -> 'a Lwt.t

  (** [timestamp_pre key thunk] mesures the current time, binds
      the resulting time measurement with the given [key]
      and stores it in the batch. It will then execute the
      given [thunk] and evaluates in its result. *)
  val timestamp_pre : Measurement.key -> (unit -> 'a) -> 'a

  (** [flush ()] cleans the batch and emits an event log that
      will display all measured times collected within the batch. *)
  val flush : unit -> unit Lwt.t
end

(** A time measurement tool that uses the given clock [C] to measure
    the time, stores resulting measurements inside the given state [S]
    and publishes stored measurements using the publisher [P]. *)
