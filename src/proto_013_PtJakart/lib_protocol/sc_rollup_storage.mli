(** Defines storage for Smart Contract Optimistic Rollups.

    {2 Commitments}

    [Commitment]s are stored directly in the L1 context. Commitments are
    immutable and content-addressed, and can be indexed by a [Commitment_hash].

    A commitment represents a claim about the state of a PVM.

    We also keep auxiliary state about each commitment, namely:

    {ul
      {li When it was first added.}
      {li Its current number of stakers.}
      }

    This auxiliary data is not part of the commitment itself. They represent
    information that the L1 knows about the claim, not the claim itself.

    {3 Predecessors and Boot state}
    Each commitment contains the hash of its {i predecessor}. Multiple
    commitments can have the same predecessor. Therefore, commitments form
    a Merkle tree.

    Conceptually the root of this tree is the [Commitment_hash.zero].  This
    commitment claims that the PVM (Proof-generating Virtual Machine) is in a
    pre-boot state and waiting to start booting by interpreting the boot sector with
    respect to the Machine semantics.

    {3 Cemented and Disputable commitments}
    Commitments accepted as true by the protocol are referred to as Cemented.

    {3 Stakers}
    The Stakers table maps Stakers (implicit accounts) to commitments.

    Let [Stakers(S)] mean "looking up the key S in [Stakers]".

    A staker [S] is directly staked on [C] if [Stakers(S) = C]. A staker [S]
    is indirectly staked on [C] if [C] is an ancestor of [Stakers(S)] in the commitment tree.

    {3 Dispute}
    Commitments that have at least one sibling are referred to as Disputed.
    More formally, a commitment C is disputed if at least one staker is not
    (directly or indirectly) staked on C.

    {3 Dispute resolution}
    The rollup protocol ensures that all disputes are resolved before cementing
    a commitment. Therefore, cemented commitments form a list rather than a tree.

    In the context we only store the Last Cemented Commitment (LCC), which is
    by definition a descendant of [zero]. We also store all Disputable
    commitments that have at least one Staker.

    For example, assuming the full set of commitments for a rollup
    looks like this:

    {[
                 LCC  staker1  staker2
                  |      |        |
                  |      V        |
                  V   --c3        |
      zero--c1 --c2--/            |
                     \            V
                      --c4------ c5
    ]}
    then commitments [c2..c5] will be stored in the context.

    {3 Conflicts}

    Let Commitments(S) be the set of commitments directly staked on by staker S.

    Two stakers A and B are:

    {ul
      {li In total agreement iff Commitments(A) = Commitments(B).}
      {li In partial agreement iff either Commitments(A) ⊂ Commitments(B), or
        Commitments(B) ⊂ Commitments(A).}
      {li In conflict iff they are neither in total or partial agreement.}}

    We can further refine a conflict to note what they are in conflict about,
    e.g. they may be in conflict about the inbox, about execution, or both. We
    can resolve conflicts by first resolving the conflict about inbox, then
    about execution (since execution is irrelevant if the inbox is not
    correct).

    Note that it is not possible to be staked on a Cemented commitment other
    than the Last, because of Cementation Rule #4. See [cement_commitment]
    for details.

    By design, the operation wrapping this should {i not} be authenticated,
    as it may be necessary for nodes on the honest branch to refund stakers on
    the LCC. They must do so by using [withdraw_stake] as they are implicitly
    staked on the LCC and can not dispute it. *)

(** [refine_stake context rollup staker commitment] moves the stake of
    [staker] to [commitment]. Because we do not assume any form of coordination
    between validators, we do not distinguish between {i adding new}
    commitments and {i staking on existing commitments}.  The storage of
    commitments is content-addressable to minimize storage duplication.

    Subsequent calls to [refine_stake] and [cement_commitment] must use
    a [context] with greater level, or behavior is undefined.

    The first time a commitment hash is staked on, it is assigned a deadline,
    which is counted in Tezos blocks (levels). Further stakes on the block does
    not affect the deadline. The commitment can not be cemented before the
    deadline has expired. Note that if a commitment is removed due to disputes
    and then re-entered, a later deadline may be assigned. Assuming one honest
    staker is always available, this only affects invalid commitments.
