    The counter is an counter-measure against replay attack. Each
    operation is signed with an integer (its counter). The counter
    is incremented when the operation is applied. This prevents the
    operation to be applied once again, since its integer will not
    be in sync with the counter of the account.  The choice of [int64]
    for the type of the counter theoretically prevents the rollup to
    an integer overflow. However, it can only happen if a single account
    makes more than [1.8446744e+19] operations. If an account sends 1000
    operations per seconds, it would take them more than 5845420
    centuries to achieve that.

    The [public_key] allows to authenticate the owner of the address,
    by verifying BLS signatures. *)
