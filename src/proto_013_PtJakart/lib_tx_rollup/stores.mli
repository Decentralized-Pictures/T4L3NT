(** Describes the different representations that can be stored persistently. *)

(** {2 Indexed stores}  *)

(** A persistent store on disk for storing L2 blocks. It is composed of an index
    file and a data file which contains the actual blocks. The keys of the index
    are the L2 block hashes. *)
module L2_block_store : sig
  (** The type of store for L2 blocks *)
  type t

  (** Returns [true] if the L2 block hash exists in the index, i.e. if the block
      exists in the store. *)
  val mem : t -> L2block.hash -> bool Lwt.t

  (** Returns the predecessor of the block (by only querying the index, without
      reading the block data). *)
  val predecessor : t -> L2block.hash -> L2block.hash option Lwt.t

  (** Returns the context hash of the block (by only querying the index, without
      reading the block data). *)
  val context :
    t -> L2block.hash -> Protocol.Tx_rollup_l2_context_hash.t option Lwt.t

  (** Read a block from the file on disk, given a L2 block hash. Returns [None]
      if the block is not stored. *)
  val read_block : t -> L2block.hash -> L2block.t option Lwt.t

  (** [append_block ?flush store block] stores the [block] in [store] updating
      its index and flushing if [flush] is set to [true] (defaults to [true]).*)
  val append_block : ?flush:bool -> t -> L2block.t -> unit Lwt.t
end

(** {2 Pure index stores}  *)

(** An index store to map Tezos block hashes to L2 block hashes. It is composed
    of an index only. This store is used to remember which Tezos blocks have been
    processed by the Tx rollup node. When there is no inbox for a Tezos block, we
    associate to it the L2 block of its predecessor. *)
module Tezos_block_store : sig
  (** The type of store for Tezos block hashes *)
  type t

  type info = {
    l2_block : L2block.hash;
    level : int32;
    predecessor : Block_hash.t;
  }

  (** Returns [true] if the Tezos block hash has a L2 block hash associated in
      the store. *)
  val mem : t -> Block_hash.t -> bool Lwt.t

  (** Returns the L2 block hash associated to a Tezos block hash in the store,
      or [None] otherwise. *)
  val find : t -> Block_hash.t -> info option Lwt.t

  (** Add an association from a Tezos block hash to an L2 block hash in the
      store. If [flush] (default to [true]) is set, the index is written on disk
      right away. *)
  val add : ?flush:bool -> t -> Block_hash.t -> info -> unit Lwt.t
end

(** An index store to map L2 block level to L2 block hashes. It is composed
    of an index only. *)
module Level_store : sig
  (** The type of store for L2 block levels *)
  type t

  (** Returns [true] if the L2 block level exists in the store. *)
  val mem : t -> L2block.level -> bool Lwt.t

  (** Returns the L2 block hash associated to a L2 block level in the store,
      or [None] otherwise. *)
  val find : t -> L2block.level -> L2block.hash option Lwt.t

  (** Add an association from a L2 block level to an L2 block hash in the
      store. If [flush] (default to [true]) is set, the index is written on disk
      right away. *)
  val add : ?flush:bool -> t -> L2block.level -> L2block.hash -> unit Lwt.t

  (** Removes a level from the store. Does nothing if the level was not
      registered. *)
  val remove : ?flush:bool -> t -> L2block.level -> unit Lwt.t
end

(** {2 Singleton stores}  *)

(** A store composed of a single file on disk to store the current head *)
module Head_store : sig
  (** The type of store for the head. *)
  type t

  (** Reads the current L2 head block hash from the disk. Returns [None] if the
      file does not exist or if it is corrupted. *)
  val read : t -> L2block.hash option Lwt.t

  (** Write the head block hash to disk. *)
  val write : t -> L2block.hash -> unit tzresult Lwt.t
end

(** A store composed of a single file on disk to store the current Tezos head *)
module Tezos_head_store : sig
  (** The type of store for the Tezos head. *)
  type t

  (** Reads the current tezos head block hash from the disk. Returns [None] if the
      file does not exist or if it is corrupted. *)
  val read : t -> Block_hash.t option Lwt.t

  (** Write the tezos head block hash to disk. *)
  val write : t -> Block_hash.t -> unit tzresult Lwt.t
end

(** Type for on disk information about a rollup *)
type rollup_info = {
  rollup_id : Protocol.Alpha_context.Tx_rollup.t;
  origination_block : Block_hash.t;
  origination_level : int32;
}

(** A store composed of a single file on disk to store the rollup
    information. This is used to guarantee consistency between several runs of
    the Tx rollup node. *)
module Rollup_info_store : sig
  (** The type of store for the rollup origination information. *)
  type t

  (** Reads the current rollup information from disk. Returns [None]
      if the file does not exist or if it is corrupted. *)
  val read : t -> rollup_info option Lwt.t

  (** Write the rollup information to disk. *)
  val write : t -> rollup_info -> unit tzresult Lwt.t

(** The type of all stores of the Tx rollup node. *)

  blocks : L2_block_store.t;
  tezos_blocks : Tezos_block_store.t;
  levels : Level_store.t;
  head : Head_store.t;
  tezos_head : Tezos_head_store.t;
  rollup_info : Rollup_info_store.t;
}

(** [init ~data_dir ~readonly ~blocks_cache_size] creates or loads existing
    stores located in the directory [data_dir]. If [readonly] (defaults to
    [false]) is set, the stores can only be read. An LRU cache of size
    [blocks_cache_size] is used for reading L2 blocks. *)
val init : data_dir:string -> readonly:bool -> blocks_cache_size:int -> t Lwt.t

(** [close store] closes all the stores by closing the indexes and the
    associated opened file descriptors. *)
val close : t -> unit Lwt.t
