(** [on_new_head cctxt handler] opens a [Monitor_services.heads] stream on the
    targeted layer 1 node and calls [handler] each time a new head is received.

    It returns a couple [(p, stopper)] where [p] is a promise resolving when the
    stream closes and [stopper] a function closing the stream.
