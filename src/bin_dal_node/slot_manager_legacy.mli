   Functions to manage slots storage.

   - writing a slot means splitting it in shards and store them on disk
   - reading a slot means rebuild it from the shards
   *)

    DAL/Node: make slot_header/commitment definition consistent with
    alpha_context.mli *)

    [commitment] at the range [shard_id]. *)
val get_shard :

    [commitment] at the ranges [shard_ids]. *)

(** [get_slot_pages] behaves as [get_slot], except that it also
    splits the slot into pages before returning them.

    Returns an [Error _] if the length of the slot associated to the
    [Cryptobox.commitment] is ill-formed. Specifically, when its
    length is not a multiple of the page-size specified in the
    [Cryptobox.parameters] argument. *)

    associated to the given [commitment] *)
