(** [make_asynchronous_log_message_consumer ()] returns a function
    that can be used with the Protocol's
    [set_log_message_consumer]. The partial application (with a single
    [()] argument) sets up the necessary machinery (message buffer,
    error management, etc.) to handle the protocol's messages. *)

(** [make_log_message_consumer ()] returns a function that can be used
