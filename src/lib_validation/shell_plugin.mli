        the input operation is a manager operation, then it is compared
        with the already present operation with minimal weight. Then
        either the minimal operation is replaced, or the new operation
        is rejected.

        If successful, return the updated state and possibly the
        replaced minimal operation, otherwise return the error
        classification for the new operation.

        before processing the new operation (in which case the mempool
        can no longer be full, so this function will succeed and return
