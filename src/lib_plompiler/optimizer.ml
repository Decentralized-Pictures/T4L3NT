(** The optimizer simplifies a constraint system, producing an equivalent one
    with fewer constraints in essentially three ways:

    - 1. {!next_gate_selectors} [qlg], [qrg] and/or [qog], which
    lead to a more compact representation of sums (linear combinations).

    - 2. {!shared_wires} among different constraints.

    - 3. {!compacting_blocks} which operate on independent wires.

    {1 Optimization Rules}

    {2:next_gate_selectors Introducing next-gate selectors}

    In a system with 3-wires architecture, adding (in a linear combination) [n]
    elements requires [n-1] constraints. For example, computing
    [out = 1 + 2 x1 + 4 x2 + 8 x3 + 16 x4 + 32 x5] can be implemented in 4
    constraints as follows:
    {[
      { a = x1;   b = x2;   c = aux1; identity = [ql 2; qr 4; qo -1; qc 1] };
      { a = x3;   b = x4;   c = aux2; identity = [ql 8; qr 16; qo -1] };
      { a = x5;   b = aux1; c = aux3; identity = [ql 32; qr 1; qo -1] };
      { a = aux2; b = aux3; c = out;  identity = [ql 1; qr 1; qo -1] };
    ]}
    Instead, by using next-gate selectors, a linear combination of [n] terms
    can be implemented in [(n-1)/2] constraints. In this case, just two:
    {[
      { a = x1; b = x2; c = out; identity = [ql 2; qr 4; qlg 8; qrg 16; qog 32; qo -1; qc 1] };
      { a = x3; b = x4; c = x5;  identity = [] };
    ]}

    {2:shared_wires Reusing shared-wires}

    Remarkably, two linear combinations that involve some common wires can be
    implemented more efficiently if they are handled together.
    For example, [out1 = 5 x + 3 y + 9 z] and [out2 = 2 x - 3 y + 7 t] can be
    implemented with 3 constraints (instead of 4) as follows:
    {[
      { a = z;        c = out1; identity = [ql 9; qlg 5; qrg 3; qog -1] };
      { a = x; b = y; c = out2; identity = [ql 2; qr -3; qrg 7; qog -1] };
      {        b = t;         ; identity = [] };
    ]}
    Furthermore, observe how, conveniently, some wires in the above constraints
    are unbound, which can lead to our next optimization.

    {2:compacting_blocks Compacting blocks}

    Consider a gate which only takes one wire as input, e.g. for computing
    [out3 = 3 w + 1], implemented with constraint:
    {[{ a = w;        c = out3; identity = [ql 3; qo -1; qc 1] }]}
    This constraint can be merged with our previous block, which only uses
    wire b in its last constraint and has unbound selectors for it:
    {[
      { a = z;        c = out1; identity = [ql 9; qlg 5; qrg 3; qog -1] };
      { a = x; b = y; c = out2; identity = [ql 2; qr -3; qrg 7; qog -1] };
      { a = w; b = t; c = out3; identity = [ql 3; qo -1; qc 1] };
    ]}

    {1 Algorithm}

    The optimization proceeds in several steps:

    1. Collect information about all linear constraints/gates (see {!is_linear}),
    including the number of occurrences of their output wire among the circuit.

    2. Inline any {!type:linear_computation} whose output is used only once
    among the circuit, in the computation where it is used (only if the latter
    is also linear).

    3. Transform any non-inlined linear computation into a {!type:pseudo_block}
    and join pseudo blocks that share at least a wire (preferably two wires).

    4. Transform pseudo blocks to actual blocks (also considering the non-linear
    computations that were left aside) and join blocks that operate on
    independent wires together. *)

    (when considering the term variables, coefficients may be different).
    Note that the pc_head may contain extra terms that do not appear in the
    previous pc_tail.

    after the convertion. Consequently the second iteration of this function

(** [place_over_block ~perfectly pb pb'] tries to join block [b1] on top
    of [b2]. It works only if the last constraint of [b1] has no selectors.
    [perfectly] returns only matches that have no empty selectors (no holes).
    It is relevant for a heuristic where we first want to find perfect matches
    and then any match.

    The joining is done by
    - finding a permutation that makes the wires of b1.last and b2.first match
      (being relaxed about unset wires)
    - checking if the permutation if perfect and failing if required
    - renaming the selectors of b1.last
    - renaming the next selectors of b1.second_last

    Example:
    [ (1 1 1)  [ql:a qlg:b]
      (3 2 -1) [] ]
    [ (2 3 4)  [ql:a]
      (1 1 1)  [ql:a] ]
    becomes
    [ (1 1 1)  [ql:a qrg:b]
      (2 3 4)  [ql:a]
      (1 1 1)  [ql:a] ]
