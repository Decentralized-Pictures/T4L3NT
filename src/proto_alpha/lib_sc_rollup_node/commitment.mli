(** The rollup node stores and publishes commitments for the PVM
    every 20 levels.

    Every time a finalized block is processed  by the rollup node,
    the latter determines whether the last commitment that the node
    has produced referred to 20 blocks earlier. In this case, it
    computes and stores a new commitment in a level-indexed map.

    Stored commitments are signed by the rollup node operator
    and published on the layer1 chain. To ensure that commitments
    produced by the rollup node are eventually published,
    storing and publishing commitments are decoupled. Every time
    a new head is processed, the node tries to publish the oldest
    commitment that was not published already.
