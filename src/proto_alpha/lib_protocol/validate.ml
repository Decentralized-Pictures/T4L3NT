(** {2 Validation of voting operations}

    There are two kinds of voting operations:

    - Proposals: A delegate submits a list of protocol amendment
      proposals. This operation is only accepted during a Proposal period
      (see above).

    - Ballot: A delegate casts a vote for/against the current proposal
      (or pass). This operation is only accepted during an Exploration
      or Promotion period (see above). *)

      - The counters in a batch are successive, and the first of them
        is the source's next expected counter.

      - A batch contains at most one Reveal operation that must occur
        in first position.

      - The source's public key has been revealed (either before the
        considered batch, or during its first operation).

      Note that currently, the [op] batch contains only one signature,
      so all operations in the batch are required to originate from the
      same manager. This may change in the future, in order to allow
      several managers to group-sign a sequence of operations. *)
