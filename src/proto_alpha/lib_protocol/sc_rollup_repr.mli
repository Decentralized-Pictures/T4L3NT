(** The basic components of an optimistic rollup for smart-contracts. *)

(**

   An optimistic rollup for smart-contracts is made of two main
   components:

   - a proof generating virtual machine (PVM), which provides the
   essential semantics for the rollup operations to be validated by
   the layer 1 in case of dispute about a commitment ;

   - a database which maintains the cemented operations of the rollup
   as well as the potentially-disputed operations.

*)

(** A smart-contract rollup has an address starting with "scr1". *)
module Address : sig
  include S.HASH

  (** [from_nonce nonce] produces an address completely determined by
     an operation hash and an origination counter. *)
  val from_nonce : Origination_nonce.t -> t tzresult

  (** [encoded_size] is the number of bytes needed to represent an address. *)
  val encoded_size : int
end

module Internal_for_tests : sig
  val originated_sc_rollup : Origination_nonce.t -> Address.t
end

module Commitment_hash : S.HASH

module State_hash : S.HASH

(** Number of messages consumed by a single commitment. This represents a claim
    about the shape of the Inbox, which can be disputed as part of a commitment
    dispute.

    See also {!Sc_rollup_repr.Commitments}. *)
module Number_of_messages : Bounded.Int32.S

(** Number of ticks computed by a single commitment. This represents a claim
    about the state of the PVM, which can be disputed as part of a commitment
    dispute.

    See also {!Sc_rollup_repr.Commitments}. *)
module Number_of_ticks : Bounded.Int32.S

(** A commitment represents a claim about the state of the Inbox and PVM at
    some Inbox level.

    More formally, a commitment is a claim that:

    {ul
      {li assuming the PVM and Inbox are in a state implied by [predecessor]}
      {li the PVM consumes [number_of_messages] messages tagged with
      [inbox_level] from the Inbox}
      {li the PVM advances to the state [compressed_state] over
      [number_of_ticks] ticks }
    }

    Commitments are disjoint. The next correct commitment is a function of the
    previous machine state and Inbox.

    [number_of_messages] and [inbox_level] can be proven/disproven by Merkle
    proofs on the Inbox state.

    [compressed_state] and [number_of_ticks] can be proven/disproven by PVM
    execution, or equivalently, by an interactive proof game between
    conflicting parties, such that a correct executor always wins the game.
