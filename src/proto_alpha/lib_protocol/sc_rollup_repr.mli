(** The basic components of an optimistic rollup for smart-contracts. *)

(**

   An optimistic rollup for smart-contracts is made of two main
   components:

   - a proof generating virtual machine (PVM), which provides the
   essential semantics for the rollup operations to be validated by
   the layer 1 in case of dispute about a commitment ;

   - a database which maintains the cemented operations of the rollup
   as well as the potentially-disputed operations.

*)

(** A smart rollup has an address starting with "sr1". *)
module Address : sig
  include
    module type of Smart_rollup_address with type t = Smart_rollup_address.t

     context_hash_to_state_hash (without changing content of HASH.S) *)

  val hash_string : unreachable -> t

(** Number of ticks computed by a single commitment. This represents a claim
    about the state of the PVM, which can be disputed as part of a commitment
    dispute.
