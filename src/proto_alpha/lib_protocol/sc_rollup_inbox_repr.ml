   A Merkelized inbox represents a list of messages. This list
   is decomposed into sublists of messages, one for each non-empty Tezos
   level greater than the level of the Last Cemented Commitment (LCC).

   This module is designed to:

   1. provide a space-efficient representation for proofs of inbox
   inclusions (only for inboxes obtained at the end of block
   validation) ;

   2. offer an efficient function to add a new batch of messages in the
   inbox at the current level.

   To solve (1), we use a proof tree H which is implemented by a sparse
   merkelized skip list allowing for compact inclusion proofs (See
   {!skip_list_repr.ml}).

   To solve (2), we maintain a separate proof tree C witnessing the
   contents of messages of the current level.

   The protocol maintains the hashes of the head of H, and the root hash of C.

   The rollup node needs to maintain a full representation for C and a
   partial representation for H back to the level of the LCC.

  (*

   At a given level, an inbox is composed of metadata of type [t] and
   [current_level], a [tree] representing the messages of the current level
   (held by the [Raw_context.t] in the protocol).

   The metadata contains :
   - [rollup] : the address of the rollup ;
   - [level] : the inbox level ;
   - [message_counter] : the number of messages in the [level]'s inbox ;
     the number of messages that have not been consumed by a commitment cementing ;
   - [nb_messages_in_commitment_period] :
     the number of messages during the commitment period ;
   - [starting_level_of_current_commitment_period] :
     the level marking the beginning of the current commitment period ;
   - [current_level_hash] : the root hash of [current_level] ;
   - [old_levels_messages] : a witness of the inbox history.

   When new messages are appended to the current level inbox, the
   metadata stored in the context may be related to an older level.
   In that situation, an archival process is applied to the metadata.
   This process saves the [current_level_hash] in the
   [old_levels_messages] and empties [current_level]. It then
   initialises a new level tree for the new messages---note that any
   intermediate levels are simply skipped. See
   {!Make_hashing_scheme.archive_if_needed} for details.
