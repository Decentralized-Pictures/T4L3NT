(** This module introduces the semantics of Proof-generating Virtual Machines.

   A PVM defines an operational semantics for some computational
   model. The specificity of PVMs, in comparison with standard virtual
   machines, is their ability to generate and to validate a *compact*
   proof that a given atomic execution step turned a given state into
   another one.

   In the smart-contract rollups, PVMs are used for two purposes:

    - They allow for the externalization of rollup execution by
   completely specifying the operational semantics of a given
   rollup. This standardization of the semantics gives a unique and
   executable source of truth about the interpretation of
   smart-contract rollup inboxes, seen as a transformation of a rollup
   state.

    - They allow for the validation or refutation of a claim that the
   processing of some messages led to a given new rollup state (given
   an actual source of truth about the nature of these messages).
