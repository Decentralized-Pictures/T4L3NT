(** This module introduces the semantics of Proof-generating Virtual Machines.

    A PVM defines an operational semantics for some computational model. The
    specificity of PVMs, in comparison with standard virtual machines, is their
    ability to generate and to validate a *compact* proof that a given atomic
    execution step turned a given state into another one.

    In the smart-contract rollups, PVMs are used for two purposes:

    - They allow for the externalization of rollup execution by completely
      specifying the operational semantics of a given rollup. This
      standardization of the semantics gives a unique and executable source of
      truth about the interpretation of smart-contract rollup inboxes, seen as a
      transformation of a rollup state.

    - They allow for the validation or refutation of a claim that the processing
      of some messages led to a given new rollup state (given an actual source
      of truth about the nature of these messages).
*)

(** An input to a PVM is the [message_counter] element of an inbox at
    a given [inbox_level] and contains a given [payload].

  (** The state of the PVM denotes a state of the rollup.

      The life cycle of the PVM is as follows. It starts its execution
      from an {!initial_state}. The initial state is specialized at
      origination with a [boot_sector], using the
      {!install_boot_sector} function. The resulting state is call the
      “genesis” of the rollup.

      Afterwards, we classify states into two categories: "internal
      states" do not require any external information to be executed
      while "input states" are waiting for some information from the
      inbox to be executable. *)
  type state

  val pp : state -> (Format.formatter -> unit -> unit) Lwt.t

  (** A state is initialized in a given context. A [context]
      represents the executable environment needed by the state to
      exist. Typically, the rollup node storage can be part of this
      context to allow the PVM state to be persistent. *)
  type context

  (** A [hash] characterizes the contents of a state. *)
  type hash = Sc_rollup_repr.State_hash.t

  (** During interactive refutation games, a player may need to provide a proof
      that a given execution step is valid. The PVM implementation is
      responsible for ensuring that this proof type has the correct semantics.

      A proof [p] has four parameters:

       - [start_hash := proof_start_state p]
       - [stop_hash := proof_stop_state p]
       - [input_requested := proof_input_requested p]
       - [input_given := proof_input_given p]

      The following predicate must hold of a valid proof:

      [exists start_state, stop_state.
              (state_hash start_state == start_hash)
          AND (Option.map state_hash stop_state == stop_hash)
          AND (is_input_state start_state == input_requested)
          AND (match (input_given, input_requested) with
              | (None, No_input_required) -> eval start_state == stop_state
              | (None, Initial) -> stop_state == None
              | (None, First_after (l, n)) -> stop_state == None
              | (Some input, No_input_required) -> true
              | (Some input, Initial) ->
                  set_input input_given start_state == stop_state
              | (Some input, First_after (l, n)) ->
                  set_input input_given start_state == stop_state)]

      In natural language---the two hash parameters [start_hash] and [stop_hash]
      must have actual [state] values (or possibly [None] in the case of
      [stop_hash]) of which they are the hashes. The [input_requested] parameter
      must be the correct request from the [start_hash], given according to
      [is_input_state]. Finally there are four possibilities of [input_requested]
      and [input_given].

      - if no input is required, or given, the proof is a simple [eval]
          step ;
      - if input was required but not given, the [stop_hash] must be
          [None] (the machine is blocked) ;
      - if no input was required but some was given, this makes no sense
          and it doesn't matter if the proof is valid or invalid (this
          case will be ruled out by the inbox proof anyway) ;
      - finally, if input was required and given, the proof is a
        [set_input] step. *)
  type proof

  (** [proof]s are embedded in L1 refutation game operations using
      [proof_encoding]. Given that the size of L1 operations are limited, it is
      of *critical* importance to make sure that no execution step of the PVM
      can generate proofs that do not fit in L1 operations when encoded. If such
      a proof existed, the rollup could get stuck. *)

      blocked because the inbox is fully read. This must match with the

      a few reasons:
        - the [input_given] doesn't match the expectations of [state] ;
        - the [context] for this instance of the PVM doesn't have access
        to enough of the [state] to build the proof. *)
