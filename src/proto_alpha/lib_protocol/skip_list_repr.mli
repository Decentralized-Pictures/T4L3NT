(** This module provides an implementation of the skip list data structure. *)

(** A skip list represents a sequence of values. There are three main
    differences between these [skip list]s and OCaml standard [list]s:

    1. A skip list cannot be empty.

    2. A skip list grows at its end.

    3. Each cell of the skip list provides several back pointers
       allowing to *skip* chunk of ancestors of the sequence to directly
       jump to a given position. More precisely, given a [basis]
       parameter, the i-th back pointers of element number [n] in the
       sequence points to [n - n mod basis^i - 1].  The element number [n]
       in the sequence contains [log_basis n] back pointers.

    The skip list is defined by a pair of dereferencing function
    of type ['ptr -> ('content, 'ptr) cell] and the last cell
    of the sequence. The maintainance of this pair is left to the client.
    In particular, the client is responsible to correctly bind a cell
    to each back pointers reachable from the last cell.
