(** This module provides an implementation of the skip list data structure. *)

(** A skip list represents a sequence of values. There are three main
    differences between these [skip list]s and OCaml standard [list]s:

    1. A skip list cannot be empty.

    2. A skip list grows at its end.

    3. Each cell of the skip list provides several back pointers
       allowing to *skip* chunk of ancestors of the sequence to directly
       jump to a given position. More precisely, given a [basis]
       parameter, the i-th back pointers of element number [n] in the
       sequence points to [n - n mod basis^i - 1].  The element number [n]
       in the sequence contains [log_basis n] back pointers.

    The skip list is defined by a pair of dereferencing function
    of type ['ptr -> ('content, 'ptr) cell] and the last cell
    of the sequence. The maintainance of this pair is left to the client.
    In particular, the client is responsible to correctly bind a cell
    to each back pointers reachable from the last cell.

     pointers of type ['ptr]. *)

  (** [back_pointer cell i] returns [Some ptr] if [ptr] is the
      [i]-th back pointer of [cell]. Returns [None] if the cell
      contains less than [i + 1] back pointers. *)

    'content ->
    ('content, 'ptr) cell

  (** [back_path ~deref ~cell_ptr ~target_index] returns [Some path]
      where [path] is a sequence of back pointers to traverse to go
      from [cell_ptr] to the cell at position [target_index] in the
      sequence denoted by [(deref, cell_ptr)]. *)
  val back_path :
    deref:('ptr -> ('content, 'ptr) cell option) ->
    cell_ptr:'ptr ->
    target_index:int ->
    'ptr list option

  (** [valid_back_path ~equal_ptr ~deref ~cell_ptr ~target_ptr path]
      returns [true] iff [path] is a valid and minimal path from
      [cell_ptr] to [target_ptr] in the skip list denoted by
      [(deref, cell_ptr)]. *)
  val valid_back_path :
    equal_ptr:('ptr -> 'ptr -> bool) ->
    deref:('ptr -> ('content, 'ptr) cell option) ->
    cell_ptr:'ptr ->
    target_ptr:'ptr ->
    'ptr list ->
    bool

  (** [search ~deref ~compare ~cell_ptr] is similar to {!back_path} except
      that it will search through the skip list to find a cell at which
      [compare content] is zero. This will only work if [compare] is a
      function that returns a negative integer for cells before the
      target and a positive integer for cells after the target.

      If [d] is the distance in the skip list between the original
      [cell_ptr] and the final target cell, this function involves
      [O(log_basis(d))] calls to [deref] and [compare] (the logarithm's
      base is the [basis] parameter in the skip list). *)
  val search :
    deref:('ptr -> ('content, 'ptr) cell option) ->
    compare:('content -> int Lwt.t) ->
    cell_ptr:'ptr ->
