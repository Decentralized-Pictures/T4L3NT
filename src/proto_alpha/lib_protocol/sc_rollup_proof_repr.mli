(** A refutation game proof is required as part of the final move in a
    game.

    This proof is basically a combination of a PVM proof (provided by
    each implementation of the PVM signature) and an input proof. To
    check the proof we must check each part separately and then also
    check that they match on the two points where they touch:

      - the [input_requested] of the PVM proof should match the starting
      point of the input proof ;

      - the [input_given] of the PVM proof should match the output
      message of the input proof.

    It is also often the case that the PVM proof has [No_input_required]
    for its [input_requested] and [None] for its [input_given]. If this
    is the case, we don't need the input proof at all and the [input_proof]
    parameter in our proof should be [None]. *)

  | Metadata_proof

(** A PVM proof [pvm_step] is combined with an [input_proof] to provide
    the proof necessary to validate a single step in the refutation
    game.

    If the step doesn't involve any input, [proof_input_requested
    pvm_step] and [proof_input_given pvm_step] will be
    [No_input_required] and [None] respectively, and in this case
    [inbox] should also be [None].

    In the case that input is involved, [input_proof] is either:

    - a proof of the next inbox message available from the inbox
      after a given location; this must match up with [pvm_step]
      to give a valid refutation proof ; or

    - a proof of a reveal satisfiability.

(** Check the validity of a proof.

    This function requires a few bits of data (available from the
    refutation game record in the storage):

      - a snapshot of the inbox, that may be used by the [input] proof ;

      - the inbox level of the commitment, used to determine if an
        output from the [input] proof is too recent to be allowed into
        the PVM proof ;

      - the [pvm_name], used to check that the proof given has the right
        PVM kind.

    It also returns the optional input executed during the proof and the
    input_request for the state at the beginning of the proof.

(** [produce ~metadata pvm_and_state inbox_context inbox_history commit_level]
    will construct a full refutation game proof out of the [state] given
    in [pvm_and_state].  It uses the [inbox] if necessary to provide
    input in the proof. If the input is above or at [commit_level] it
    will block it, and produce a proof that the PVM is blocked. If
    the input requested is a reveal the proof production will also
    fail.

    This will fail if any of the [context], [inbox_context] or
    [inbox_history] given don't have enough data to make the proof. For
    example, the 'protocol implementation' version of each PVM won't be
    able to run this function. Similarly, the version of the inbox
    stored in the L1 won't be enough because it forgets old levels.

    This uses the [name] in the [pvm_and_state] module to produce an
    encodable [wrapped_proof] if possible. See the [wrap_proof] function
    in [Sc_rollups].

    It also need the [metadata] if it produces a proof for the [Needs_metadata]
    state.
