(** Slot attestation representation for the data-availability layer.

    {1 Overview}

    For the data-availability layer, the layer 1 provides a list of
   slots at every level (see {!Dal_slot_repr}). Slots are not posted
   directly onto L1 blocks. Stakeholders, called attestors in this
   context, can commit on the availability of the data (via
   endorsements or attestation operations, see
   https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/issues/3115).

    The slot is uniformly split into shards. Each attestor commits,
   for every slot, on the availability of all shards they are assigned
   to.

    This module encapsulates the representation of this commitment
   that aims to be provided with endorsement operations. To avoid
   overloading the network, this representation should be compact.  *)

type t

(** The shape of Dal attestation operations injected by delegates. *)
type operation = {
  attestor : Signature.Public_key_hash.t;
      (** The account who attests the availability of the slots. *)
  attestation : t;
      (** The bitset of slots that are attested to be available. *)
  level : Raw_level_repr.t;
      (** The level at which the operation is valid. It should be equal to the
          attested slot's published level plus the DAL attestation lag. *)
}

val encoding : t Data_encoding.t

(** [empty] returns an empty [slot_attestation] which commits that
   every slot are unavailable. *)
val empty : t

(** [is_attested slot_attestation ~index] returns [true] if the
   [slot_attestation] commits that the slot at [index] is
   available. *)
val is_attested : t -> Dal_slot_index_repr.t -> bool

(** [commit slot_attestation index] commits into [slot_attestation]
   that the slot [index] is available. *)
val commit : t -> Dal_slot_index_repr.t -> t

(** [occupied_size_in_bits slot_attestation] returns the size in bits of an attestation. *)
val occupied_size_in_bits : t -> int

(** [expected_size_in_bits ~max_index] returns the expected size (in
   bits) of an attestation considering the maximum index for a slot is
   [max_index]. *)
val expected_size_in_bits : max_index:Dal_slot_index_repr.t -> int

(** A shard_index aims to be a positive number. *)

module Shard_map : Map.S with type key = shard_index

(** This module is used to record the shard attestations.

   For each attestor, a list of shards is associated. For each
   attested slot (see {!type:t}) we record that those shards were
   deemed available.

   This information will be used at the end of block finalisation to
   have the protocol declaring whether the slot is available.  *)

  (** The data-structure used to record the shards attestations. *)

  (** DAL/FIXME https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/issues/3145

     Consider using the [Bounded] module. In particular, change the
     semantics of [is_slot_attested] accordingly. *)

  (** [init ~length] initialises a new accountability data-structure
     with at most [length] slots and where for every slot, no shard is
     available. *)
  val init : length:int -> t

  (** [record_attested_shards t slots shards] records that for all
     slots declared available in [slots], the shard indices in [shards]
     are deemed available. It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure
     the shard indices are positive numbers. A negative shard index is
     ignored. *)
  val record_attested_shards : t -> attested_slots -> shard_index list -> t

  (** [is_slot_attested t ~threshold ~number_of_shards slot] returns
     [true] if the number of shards recorded in [t] for the [slot] is
     above the [threshold] with respect to the total number of shards
     specified by [number_of_shards]. Returns [false] otherwise or if
     the [index] is out of the interval [0;length] where [length] is
     the value provided to the [init] function. *)
