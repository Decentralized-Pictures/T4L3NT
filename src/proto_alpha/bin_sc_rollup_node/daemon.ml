  (* [on_layer_1_chain_event node_ctxt store chain_event] processes a

     that have not been recognised as finalised by the rollup node. This list
     has been set by the last iteration of [on_layer_1_chain_event] in
     the {!daemonize} function, or it is the empty list if the rollup node is
     executing [on_layer_1_chain_event] for the very first time.
     These are heads included in
     the branch currently tracked by the rollup node, and that
     have only been partially processed, due to the rollup  node not being able
     to establish their finality. The function persists to disk the list of
     heads from the current branch tracked by the rollup node,
     whose finality cannot be established at the time the function is invoked.
     Those heads will be processed again at the next iteration of
     [on_layer_1_chain_event] in the [daemonize] function. If [chain_event] is
     a rollback event, then the list of heads persisted to disk is reset to the
     empty list, as the rollup node started tracking a new branch.
     Because heads that still have not been processed as finalized are
     persisted to disk, this function is robust against interruptions.
