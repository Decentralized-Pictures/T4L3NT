(** This module implements the refutation game logic of the rollup
   node.

   When a new L1 block arises, the rollup node asks the L1 node for
   the current game it is part of, if any.

   If a game is running and it is the rollup operator turn, the rollup
   node injects the next move of the winning strategy.

   If a game is running and it is not the rollup operator turn, the
   rollup node asks the L1 node whether the timeout is reached to play
   the timeout argument if possible.

   Otherwise, if no game is running, the rollup node asks the L1 node
   whether there is a conflict with one of its disputable commitments. If
   there is such a conflict with a commitment C', then the rollup node
   starts a game to refute C' by starting a game with one of its staker.
