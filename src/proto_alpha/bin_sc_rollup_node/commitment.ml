(** The rollup node stores and publishes commitments for the PVM every
    [Constants.sc_rollup_commitment_period_in_blocks] levels.

    Every time a finalized block is processed by the rollup node, the latter
    determines whether the last commitment that the node has produced referred
    to [sc_rollup.commitment_period_in_blocks] blocks earlier. For mainnet,
    [sc_rollup.commitment_period_in_blocks = 30]. In this case, it computes and
    stores a new commitment in a level-indexed map.

    Stored commitments are signed by the rollup node operator
    and published on the layer1 chain. To ensure that commitments
    produced by the rollup node are eventually published,
    storing and publishing commitments are decoupled. Every time
    a new head is processed, the node tries to publish the oldest
    commitment that was not published already.
