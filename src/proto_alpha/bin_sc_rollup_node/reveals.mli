(** This module provides basic support for reveals.

    The rollup can ask for data being the reveal of some hash. This
    allows transferring data directly to the rollup without going
    through the L1 inbox.

    Data length must be under 4KB to be refutable in a single L1
    operation.

    Data must be made available by off-chain mechanisms: it is the
    responsibility of the rollup kernel to make sure that the reveal
    data is available: otherwise, there is a potential safety issue.

    For the moment, the support is basic and mostly manual as the operator
    needs to explicitly import a file in the rollup node data directoy to
    enable the rollup node to answer reveal requests.

*)

(* FIXME:https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/issues/3854

   We should probably have a mechanism to let the kernel declare
   sources of reveal data so that the rollup node can automatically
   download data in advance. *)
