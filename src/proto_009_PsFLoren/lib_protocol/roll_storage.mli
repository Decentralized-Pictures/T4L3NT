   Basic roll manipulation.

   The storage related to roll (i.e. `Storage.Roll`) is not used outside of
   this module. And, this interface enforces the invariant that a roll is
   always either in the limbo list or owned by a delegate.

   [init ctxt] returns a new context initialized from [ctxt] where the next

   [init_first_cycles ctxt] computes a new context from [ctxt] where the store
   has been prepared to save roll snapshots for all cycles from [0] to
   [Constants.preserved_cycles + 2]:

   1. rolls for all cycles in the interval [(0, preserved_cycles)] are frozen
      (after taking a snapshot),
   2. a snapshot is taken for rolls of cycle [preserved_cycles + 1],
   3. rolls for cycle [preserved_cycles + 2] are ready for a snapshot, i.e. the

      the freezing of [c]),
   2. freezes snapshot rolls for the cycle
      [(last_cycle + preserved_cycles + 1)] (this amounts to removing all
      snapshots for the cycle, except one randomly selected for computing
      baking rights),
   3. makes cycle [(last_cycle + preserved_cycles + 2)] ready for snapshot.

   1. the snapshot index associated to cycle [c] is incremented,

      [(c,index)] (where [index] is the current snapshot index of cycle [c]),
   3. the last roll for cycle [c], and snapshot [index] is set to be the next

   are considered, rolls without owners are skipped. The first parameter of [f]
   is a roll [r], the second parameter of [f] is the owner of [r], and the last
   parameter is the initial value of the accumulator.
