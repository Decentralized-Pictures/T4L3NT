(** A polynomial protocol allows a prover to convince a verifier of the fact
    that certain algebraic identites between polynomials (polynomials that have
    been previously committed) hold when evaluated over a set of points.
    (In our implementation such set of points must be a subgroup of roots of
    unity.)

    For example, let K be a field and let H be a subset of K.
    Let f1(X), f2(X) and f3(X) be univariate polynomials over K and let
    C1, C2 and C3 be polynomial commitments to f1, f2 and f3, respectively.
    A polynomial protocol allows a prover to argue knowledge of:
    {[
      PoK{ (f1, f2, f3) : Ci = Com(fi) ∀ i  /\  f1(x) * f2(x) = f3(x) ∀ x ∈ H }
    ]}
    This can be accomplished by evaluating polynomial commitments at a single
    point ξ (uniformly sampled from K). For that, note that the above
    polynomial identity holds for every x ∈ H iff polynomial (f1 * f2 - f3) is
    divisible by Zh, the minimal (monic) polynomial that vanishes over set H.
    Thus, the prover can commit to polynomial T := (f1 * f2 - f3) / Zh and
    evaluate polynomial commitments C1, C2, C3, T at ξ (chosen after T). Let
    c1, c2, c3, t be such evaluations.
    The verifier can then check that  t * Zh(ξ) = c1 * c2 - c3.

    A general polynomial protocol should allow for multiple identities involving
    addition, multiplication and composition of polynomials.

    See {{: https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953.pdf }2019/953 Section 4.1} for
    more details. *)
