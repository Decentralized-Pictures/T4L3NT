      participates in constraint number [shift + i], where equality will be
      asserted with respect to a PlonK variable in the same constraint.
      This allows us to "load" the value of [secret.(i)] into the variable, which
      may be reused across the circuit.
      The optional argument [shift] has a default value of 0.
      The commitment is relative to a certain domain size [n], included in [pp],
      the secret will remain information-theoretically hidden as long as the
      commitment is involved in at most [n - |secret|] different proofs.
      If the optionnal argument [size] is given, the secret will be padded with
      zeros to have the length [size] (note that an error will be risen if size
      is smaller than the secret length).
