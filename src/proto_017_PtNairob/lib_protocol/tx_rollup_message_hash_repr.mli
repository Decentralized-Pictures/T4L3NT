(** The Blake2B hash of a message.

    To avoid unnecessary storage duplication, the inboxes in the
    layer-1 do not contain the messages, but their hashes (see
    {!Tx_rollup_inbox_storage.append_message}). This is possible
    because the content of the messages can be reconstructed off-chain
    by looking at the layer-1 operations and their receipt. *)

    without any gas consumption. *)
