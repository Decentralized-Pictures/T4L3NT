   In this test, we check that [best_basis] should be used to optimize
   the size of Merkel proofs based on skip lists. In such a context,
   the skip lists are referenced by Blake2B hashes (32 bytes-long) and
   their contents are also Blake2B hashes. Besides, a Merkel proof is
   a list of cells.

   To that end, we consider a deterministic sample of pairs [(n,
   target)] when [n] is the length of the skip list and [target] is
   the index of a cell in the skip list. Then, for each basis in [2
   .. max_basis] distinct from [best_basis], we check that the largest
