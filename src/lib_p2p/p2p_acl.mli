(** This module implements four Access Control Lists:

   - IP greylist is a set of banned IP addresses automatically added
   by the P2P layer.

   - [peer_id] greylist is a set of banned peers ids automatically
   added by the P2P layer.

   - IP blacklist is a set of IP addresses manually added by the node
   admin.

   - peers blacklist is a set of peers ids manually added by the node
   admin.

   IP greylists use a time based GC to periodically remove entries
   from the table, while [peer_id] greylists are built using an LRU
   cache, where the least-recently grey-listed peer is evicted from
   the table when adding a new banned peer to a full cache. Other
   tables are user defined and static.

(** [create ~peer_id_size ~ip_size] is a set of four ACLs (see above)
   with the peer_id greylist being a LRU cache of size [peer_id_size]
   and the IP address greylist a bloom filter of size [ip_size]
   (expressed in KiB). Elements are (probabilistically) kept in the
   bloom filter for [ip_cleanup_delay], the cleanup happens in a
   discrete way in sixteen steps. *)

      distribution of cells (measured in [gc] calls) stored as
      an array: the value at index [k] stores the number
      of cells that are [k] calls to [gc] away from being
