(** This module defines the messages of the P2p layers.

    P2p messages are parameterized by a generic upper-layer message type
    ['msg]. The P2p layer serializes these ['msg] using a ['msg encoding']
    provided by the client of this lib.

    The P2p protocol is simple and can be deduced mostly from the message type.
    To make the network topology more dynamic, it implements a simple peer
    swapping mechanism which works as follows.

    Peer A sends a message : [Swap_request (point, peer)] to B.
    If B is already connected to the peer, the message is ignored.
    Otherwise B picks a peer [peer'] at point [point'] and connect to [peer]. If
    successful, it sends a response [Swap_ack (point', peer')] to A. Upon
    reception of [Swap_ack]. B tries to connected to [peer']. If successful,
    it disconnect from [peer].

    TODO: It would be interesting to measure the effect of the swap request
          mechanism on an actual network. Is it the added complexity
          worth it, wouldn't it  be enough to rely on [Advertise]? *)
