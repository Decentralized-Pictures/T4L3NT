(** This module defines a type [t] which wraps a file descriptor. Most
    functions simply call the underlying file descriptor function and generate
    logs with prefix "p2p.fd". *)

type t

(* [close_reason] is used by the functions [read] or [write] in case of error.

   [`Connection_closed_by_peer] is returned when the socket returns 0 bytes read
   or written.

   [`Connection_lost] is returned when the connection was closed
   because of a timeout or another problem related to the remote peer.

   [`Connection_locally_closed] is returned when the connection's socket
   has been locally closed before we try to access it.

   [`Unexpected_error_when_closing (exn1,exn2)] is returned when two unexpected errors
   occurred: a first one [exn1] which triggered an attempt to close the socket, and a
   second one [exn2] whilst closing the socket.

   [`Unexpected_error] is returned in case of an error not caught by the
   previous cases.

(** [id t] returns a unique, positive, identifier for t. Identifiers
    are generated sequentially at creation time. *)
val id : t -> int

(** [read fd buf ofs len] reads up to [len] bytes from [fd], and writes them to
    [buf], starting at offset [ofs].
    If the operation leads to a [`Connection_lost] error it  is guaranteed that the
    underlying socket has been closed.
*)
val read : t -> Bytes.t -> int -> int -> (int, close_reason) result Lwt.t

(** [close fd] close the connection and the underlying fd.
    It is idempotent.
*)
val close : t -> (unit, [`Unexpected_error of exn]) result Lwt.t

(** [write fd buf] writes all bytes from [buf] to [fd].
    If the operation leads to a [`Connection_lost] error it is guaranteed that the
    underlying socket has been closed.
*)
val write : t -> Bytes.t -> (unit, close_reason) result Lwt.t

(** Returns a fresh fd. This call always succeed. *)

(** [accept sock] accept connections on socket [sock]

    This function can fail and raise an error.

    [`System_error] : System-wide errors which are related to the state of
    whole process or computer. These are errors that will probably reoccur at
    next call and must be treated accordingly (for example by giving some time to
    the system to recover).


    [`Socket_error ] : Socket-specific errors which are related to the one
    connection that the function attempted to accept. These are usually temporary
    errors related to network delays or remote host responsiveness .
    For most socket-errors you can just log them and call accept again to be
    ready for the next connection.

    [`Unexpected_error] : These are other types of errors that can arise and not
    caught by the previous cases.
