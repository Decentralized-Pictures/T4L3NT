(** An [Answerer.t] is a set of callback functions, parameterized by
    [conn_info] record. The [conn_info] records contains values useful
    for the callback functions to perform their task, and known after
    the connection is set up.

    The callback functions are called when the node receives `P2p_messages.t`
    messages. The parameters are the values carried by the message, and
    a [request_info] record that contains values pertaining to the connection
    that may change during the life of the connection. *)
