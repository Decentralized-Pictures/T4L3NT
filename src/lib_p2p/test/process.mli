(** {1} Function evaluation in a detached process

    This library uses a process detached in a separated unix thread to
   execute a given function, with bidirectional communication channels
   and transmission of the function result at the end of the
   execution.

    The communication channels does not require a data encoding, but
   the data encoding can be given. In absence of data encoding the
   Marshal mecanism will be used. Be aware that extensible types, like
   error or exception cannot be safely exchanged between processes.

    Flags for Marshal serialisation can be passed at the creation of
   the detached process.

(** Executing a function in a detached process.
    [prefix] will be used in detached process logs.
    On canceling of [canceler], the detached process will be killed by
    SIGKILL.

    [input_encoding] and [output_encoding], if provided,  will be used
    to exchange values between the main thread and the detached thread
    [input_encoding] is for values received by the detached thread.
    [output_encoding] is for values sent by the detached thread.

    In absence of data encoding the Marshal mecanism will be  used.
    Be aware that extensible types, like error or exception cannot be
    safely exchanged between processes.

    [value_encoding] is for the encoding of the result of the detached
    function.
    The Error_monad encapsulation part of the value computed by the
    detached function will be safely encoded, even without encoding
    for the ['result] type. Ie if the detached function end with an
    error, the error will safely be serialized-deserialised.

   If no encoding is given, the values will be serialized using hte
     Marshal module, with the given [flags] (if any is provided).
