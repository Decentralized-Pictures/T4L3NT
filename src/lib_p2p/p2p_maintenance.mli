(** P2P maintenance worker.

    The P2P layer urges the maintainer to work when the number of
    connections reaches `max` or is below `min`. Otherwise, the
    maintener is lazy and only looks up for connections every two
    minutes (hardcoded constant). The [maintain] function is another
    way to signal the maintainer that a maintenance step is desired.

    When the maintener detects that the number of connections is over
    `max_threshold`, it randomly kills connections to reach
    `max_target`.

    When the maintener detects that the number of connections is below
    `min_threshold`, it creates enough connection to reach at least
    `min_target` (and never more than `max_target`). In the process, it
    might ask its actual peers for new peers.  *)
