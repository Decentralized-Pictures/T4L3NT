(** P2P maintenance worker.

    This worker enforces the connection bounds defined on the command-line
    or/and the configuration file.

    The maintenance process is launched:
    . If not launched within [maintenance_idle_time] seconds
    . When any of the following future  is resolved
        [P2p_pool.Pool_event.wait_too_few_connections]
        [P2p_pool.Pool_event.wait_too_many_connections]
        [P2p_pool.Pool_event.wait_too_few_trusted_connections]
    . When [maintain] is called

    If the number of connections is above the limit, the maintainer
    kill existing connections.

    If below the limit, it tries to connect to points available from [P2p_pool].
    If not enough connections can be obtained, it requires new points from
    [P2p_pool] using [P2p_pool.broadcast msg], and wakes up the
    [P2p_discovery] worker. It then waits for new peers or points by waiting
    on futures
      [P2p_pool.Pool_event.wait_new_peer]
      [P2p_pool.Pool_event.wait_new_point pool]
    This is reiterated indefinitely every [require_new_points_time] seconds. *)
