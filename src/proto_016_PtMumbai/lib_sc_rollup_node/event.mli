(** This module defines functions that emit the events used when the smart
    rollup node is running (see {!Daemon}). *)

open Protocol.Alpha_context

val starting_node : unit -> unit Lwt.t

val node_is_ready : rpc_addr:string -> rpc_port:int -> unit Lwt.t

(** [rollup_exists addr kind] emits the event that the smart rollup
    node is interacting with the rollup at address [addr] and of the given
    [kind]. *)
val rollup_exists : addr:Sc_rollup.t -> kind:Sc_rollup.Kind.t -> unit Lwt.t

(** [shutdown_node exit_status] emits the event that the smart rollup
    node is stopping with exit status [exit_status]. *)
val shutdown_node : int -> unit Lwt.t

(** Emits the event that the connection to the Tezos node has been lost. *)
val connection_lost : unit -> unit Lwt.t

(** [cannot_connect ~count error] emits the event that the rollup node cannot
    connect to the Tezos node because of [error] for the [count]'s time. *)
val cannot_connect : count:int -> tztrace -> unit Lwt.t

(** [wait_reconnect delay] emits the event that the rollup will wait [delay]
    seconds before attempting to reconnect to the Tezos node . *)
val wait_reconnect : float -> unit Lwt.t

(** [starting_metrics_server ~metrics_addr ~metrics_port] emits the event
    that the metrics server for the rollup node is starting. *)
val starting_metrics_server : host:string -> port:int -> unit Lwt.t

(** [metrics_ended error] emits the event that the metrics server
    has ended with a failure. *)
val metrics_ended : string -> unit Lwt.t

(** [metrics_ended error] emits the event that the metrics server
    has ended with a failure.
    (Doesn't wait for event to be emited. *)
val metrics_ended_dont_wait : string -> unit

(** [kernel_debug str] emits the event that the kernel has logged [str]. *)
val kernel_debug : string -> unit Lwt.t

(** [kernel_debug str] emits the event that the kernel has logged [str].
    (Doesn't wait for event to be emitted) *)
val kernel_debug_dont_wait : string -> unit

(** [warn_dal_enabled_no_node ()] emits a warning for when DAL is enabled in the
    protocol but the rollup node has no DAL node. *)
val warn_dal_enabled_no_node : unit -> unit Lwt.t

(** [acquiring_lock ()] emits an event to indicate that the node is attempting
    to acquire a lock on the data directory. *)
