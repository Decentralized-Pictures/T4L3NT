     inbox. Therefore, it is of significant importance that
     a valid batch does not produce a list of withdraw
     orders which could not fit in a layer-1 operation.

     With these values, at least 2048 bytes remain available

     Timeout logic is similar to a chess clock. Each player starts with the same
     timeout = [timeout_period_in_blocks]. Each game move updates the timeout of
     the current player by decreasing it by the amount of time she took to play,
     i.e. number of blocks since the opponent last move. See
     {!Sc_rollup_game_repr.timeout} and
     {!Sc_rollup_refutation_storage.game_move} to see the implementation.

     Because of that [timeout_period_in_blocks] must be at least half the upper
     bound number of blocks needed for a game to finish. This bound is
     correlated to the maximum distance allowed between the first and last tick
     of a dissection. For example, when the maximum distance allowed is half the
     total distance [(last_tick - last_tick) / 2] then bound is [Log^2
     (Int64.max_int) + 2 = 65]. See {!Sc_rollup_game_repr.check_dissection} for
     more information on the dissection logic. *)
