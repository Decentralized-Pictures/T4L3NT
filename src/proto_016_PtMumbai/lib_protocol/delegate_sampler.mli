(** This module draws random values for a cycle based on the {!Seed_repr.seed}
   associated that cycle. These random values are:
    - delegates associated with slots
    - snapshot indexes.
   The selection of delegates is done by {i sampling} from a particular
   distribution of the stake among the active delegates.

   This module is responsible for maintaining the table
   {!Storage.Delegate_sampler_state}. *)

(** Participation slots potentially associated to accounts. The
   accounts that didn't place a deposit will be excluded from this
   list. This function should only be used to compute the deposits to
   freeze or initialize the protocol while stitching. RPCs can use this
   function to predict an approximation of long term future slot
   allocations. It shouldn't be used in the baker. *)
