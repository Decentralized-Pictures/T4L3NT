(** [Error_monad]-aware replacements for parts of the Stdlib.

    This library aims to provide replacements to some parts of the Stdlib that:

    - do not raise exceptions (e.g., it shadows [Map.find] with [Map.find_opt]),
    - include traversal functions for Lwt (think [Lwt_list] for [List]),
      [tzresult], and the combined [tzresult]-Lwt monad (think the
      list-traversal functions from [Error_monad].

    The aim is to allow the use of the standard OCaml data-structures within the
    context of Lwt and the Error monad. This is already somewhat available for
    [List] through the combination of {!Stdlib.List} (for basic functionality),
    {!Lwt_list} (for the Lwt-aware traversals), and {!Error_monad} (for the
    error-aware and combined-error-lwt-aware traversal).

    More and more modules will be added to this Library. In particular [List]
    (to avoid splitting the functionality from three distinct libraries and to
    provide more consistent coverage), [Array], and [Option] will be made
    available.
