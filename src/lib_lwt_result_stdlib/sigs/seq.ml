(** A wrapper around {!Stdlib.Seq} that includes lwt-, error- and
    lwt-error-aware traversal functions.

    All traversal functions that are suffixed with [_e] are within the error
    monad. Note that this functions have a “fail-early” behaviour: the traversal
    is interrupted as when any of the intermediate application fails (i.e.,
    returns an [Error _]).

    All traversal functions that are suffixed with [_s] are within Lwt. These
    functions traverse the elements sequentially: the promise for a given step
    of the traversal is only initiated when the promise for the previous step is
    resolved. Note that these functions have a fail-early behaviour: the
    traversal is interrupted if any of the intermediate promise is rejected.

    All the traversal functions that are suffixed with [_p] are within Lwt.
    These functions traverse the elements concurrently: the promise for all the
    steps are created immediately. The suffix [_p] is chosen for similarity with
    the {!Lwt_list} functions even though, as with {!Lwt_list}'s functions there
    is no parallelism involved, only concurrency. Note that these functions have
    a “best-effort” behaviour: the whole-traversal promise (i.e., the promise
    returned by the [_p]-suffixed function) only resolves once each of the step
    promises have resolved. Even if one of the step promise is rejected, the
    whole-traversal promise is only rejected once all the other step promises
    have resolved.

    All the traversal functions that are suffixed with [_es] are within the
    combined error-and-Lwt monad. These function traverse the elements
    sequentially with a fail-early behaviour for both rejection (as an Lwt
    promise) and failure (as a result).

    All the traversal functions that are suffixed with [_ep] are within the
    combined error-and-Lwt monad. These function traverse the elements
    concurrently with a best-effort behaviour.
