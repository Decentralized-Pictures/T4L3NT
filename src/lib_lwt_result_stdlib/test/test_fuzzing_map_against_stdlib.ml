(* The test framework [Test_fuzzing_lib] uses [char] as the type of values
   stored inside the collections being tested. For variety, we use [int] for the
   type of keys, but we keep [char] for all the elements of all the maps tested
   below. *)

module Map = Support.Lib.Map.Make (Int)

(* A large part of Map is defined by inclusion of Stdlib's Map. We only test the
   rest. *)

(* NOTE: The testing framework ([Test_fuzzing_lib]) is focused on testing the
   return values of a set of functions. [iter] (and friends) always return [()]
   (modulo the monad). As a result, in a simple test, all calls would be
   equivalent and the simple test would not mean anything. Instead we implement
   [fold] on top of [iter] and test this. *)
