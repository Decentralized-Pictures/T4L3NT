(** The [S] signature is similar to {!Seq.S} except that suspended nodes are
    wrapped in a promise.

    This allows some additional traversors ([map_s], etc.) to be applied lazily.

    The functions [of_seq] and [of_seq_s] allow conversion from vanilla
    sequences. *)

      its single element. *)

      sequence if [s] is. *)

      resolves), it resolves to [Some x] where [x] is the first element of [s],
      it does not resolve if the promised node of [s] doesn't.

      Note that [first] forces the first element of the sequence, which can have
      side-effects or be computationally expensive. Consider, e.g., the case
      where [s = filter (fun â€¦) s']: [first s] can force multiple of the values
      from [s']. *)

  (** Similar to {!fold_left} but applies to Lwt-suspended sequences. Because
      the nodes are suspended in promises, traversing may yield and,

      either:
      - is rejected if at least one of the promises is, otherwise
      - is fulfilled with [Error _] if at least one of the promises is,

      steps of the iteration are started concurrently: one iteration is started
      as soon as the node becomes resolved. The promise [iter_p f s]
      is resolved only once all the promises of the iteration are. At this point
      it is either fulfilled if all promises are, or rejected if at least one of
