(** This module provides a temporary toy rollup to be used as a demo. *)

(**

   This rollup is a stack machine equipped with addition.

   It processes postfix arithmetic expressions written as sequence of
   (space separated) [int] and [+] using the following rules:

   - a number [x] is interpreted as pushing [x] on the stack ;

   - a variable [a] is interpreted as storing the topmost element of the
     stack in the storage under the name "a" ;

   - a variable [out] is interpreted as adding a message to the outbox
     containing a single transaction batch with the topmost element of the
     stack as payload, the zero contract as destination, and a default
     entrypoint ;

   - a symbol [+] pops two integers [x] and [y] and pushes [x + y] on
     the stack ;

   If a message is not syntactically correct or does not evaluate
   correctly, the machine stops its evaluation and waits for the next
   message.

   The machine has a boot sector which is a mere string used a prefix
   for each message.

   The module implements the {!Sc_rollup_PVM_sig.S}ÃŽ interface to be
   used in the smart contract rollup infrastructure.

   The machine exposes extra operations to be used in the rollup node.

  (** [get_is_stuck state] returns [Some err] if some internal error
