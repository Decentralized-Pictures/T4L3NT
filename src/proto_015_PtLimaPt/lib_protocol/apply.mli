(** This module supports advancing the ledger state by applying [operation]s.

    Each operation application takes and returns an [application_state], representing
    the old and new state, respectively.

    The [Main] module provides wrappers for the functionality in this module,
    satisfying the Protocol signature.

(** Apply an operation, i.e. update the given context in accordance
    with the operation's semantic (or return an error if the operation
    is not applicable).

    For non-manager operations, the application of a validated
   operation should always fully succeed.

    For manager operations, the application has two stages. The first
   stage consists in updating the context to:

    - take the fees;

    - increment the account's counter;

    - decrease of the available block gas by operation's [gas_limit].

    These updates are mandatory. In particular, taking the fees is
   critically important. The {!Validate} module is responsible for
   ensuring that the operation is solvable, i.e. that fees can be
   taken, i.e. that the first stage of manager operation application
   cannot fail. If this stage fails nevertheless, the function returns
   an error.

    The second stage of this function (still in the case of a manager
   operation) consists in applying all the other effects, in
   accordance with the semantic of the operation's kind.

    An error may happen during this second phase: in that case, the
   function returns the context obtained at the end of the first
   stage, and metadata that contain the error. This means that the
   operation has no other effects than those described above during
   the first phase. *)
