# Benchmarking EVM Kernel
## Context

The `evm_execution` crate provides functions to execute ethereum transactions in
a SORU kernel.
During development, tests were done to assess the efficiency and safety wrt the
number of ticks necessary.

## Methodology

Provide a kernel and benchmark scenarios usable with the debugger.
Obtain benchmark data from debugger output.

The benchmark kernel is used to test the `evm_execution` crate but adding just
the minimum layer to create a functionnal kernel.
- a faucet
- each message from the inbox is expected to be an rlp encoded transaction
- output execution information in debug messages (eg gas)

The benchmark scenarios are provided as scripts that generate the input data.
See `./benchmarks/`.

## How to use
- compile the benchmark kernel
```
$ make -C ../src/kernel_evm/
$ cp ../src/kernel_evm/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/kernel_benchmark.wasm .
$ wasm-strip kernel_benchmark.wasm
```
- compile the debugger
```
$ make
```
- generate inputs for a given scenario
```
$ node src/kernel_evm/kernel_benchmark/scripts/benchmarks/bench_transfers_1.js > inbox_bench_transfers_1.json
```
- execute the debugger on the kernel and the inputs
```
$ ./octez-smart-rollup-wasm-debugger kernel_benchmark.wasm --inputs inbox_bench_transfers_1.json
> load inputs
