(** {1 [Compare]}

    Monomorphic comparison for common ground types and common type constructors.

    [Compare] provides a module signature for the standard comparison functions
    and operators as well as modules of that signature for the common OCaml
    ground types ([int], [bool], etc.) and type constructors ([list], [option],
    etc.). *)

(** {2 Signatures and a functor} *)

(** [COMPARABLE] is a signature for basic comparison. It is used only for
    instantiating full comparison modules of signature {!S} via the functor
    {!Make}. *)
module type COMPARABLE = sig
  type t

  val compare : t -> t -> int
end

(** [S] is a signature for a fully-fledge comparison module. It includes all the
    functions and operators derived from a [compare] function. *)
module type S = sig
  type t

  val ( = ) : t -> t -> bool

  val ( <> ) : t -> t -> bool

  val ( < ) : t -> t -> bool

  val ( <= ) : t -> t -> bool

  val ( >= ) : t -> t -> bool

  val ( > ) : t -> t -> bool

  val compare : t -> t -> int

  val equal : t -> t -> bool

  val max : t -> t -> t

  val min : t -> t -> t
end

module Make (P : COMPARABLE) : S with type t := P.t

(** {2 Base types}

    The specialised comparison and all the specialised functions and operators
    on the base types are compatible with the polymorphic comparison and all the
    polymorphic functions and operators from the {!Stdlib}. *)

module Bytes : S with type t = bytes

module Z : S with type t = Z.t

(** {2 Type constructors}

    Provided the functor argument(s) are compatible with the polymorphic
    comparison of the {!Stdlib}, then the specialised comparison and all the
    specialised functions and operators on the derived types are compatible with
    the polymorphic comparison and all the polymorphic functions and operators
    from the {!Stdlib}. *)

  S with type t = (Ok.t, Error.t) result

(** {2 Building blocks} *)

(** [or_else c f] is [c] if [c <> 0] or [f ()] otherwise.

    The intended use is

  or_else (Foo.compare foo_a foo_b) (fun () -> Bar.compare bar_a bar_b)
]}
*)
