(** This module implements a bufferisation abstraction to store
   temporary raw data chunks (as bytes) when chunks are read
   sequentially. The function [write] allows to store chunks in the
   buffer and the function read to read them from the buffer.

   The global contract is that if we write consecutively [d1;d2] onto
   the buffer, then we have to fully read [d1] and [d2], in that order.

   This contract is not enforced by the library, it is the user
   responsibility to respect it.

   If the circular buffer is full, a new temporary buffer is
   allocated to store the chunk of data to be written. *)

(** Type of circular buffers  *)
type t

(** An abstraction over a chunk of data written in the buffer. *)
type data

(** [create ?maxlength ?fresh_buf_size ()] creates a buffer of size [maxlength]
    (by default [32] kb). If the buffer is full, a buffer of size [fresh_buf_size]
    is allocated (by default [2] kb). *)
val create : ?maxlength:int -> ?fresh_buf_size:int -> unit -> t

(** [write ~maxlen ~fill_using buffer] calls [fill_using buf offset
   maxlen] where [buf] is a buffer that has room for [maxlen] data
   starting from [offset].

   Assumes that [fill_using] returns the exact amount of written
   bytes.

   Behaviour is unspecified if [fill_using] writes more than [maxlen]
   data or lies on the number of written bytes.

   It returns a data descriptor for the supposedly written chunk. *)
val write :
  maxlen:int ->
  fill_using:(Bytes.t -> int -> int -> (int, 'error) result Lwt.t) ->
  t ->
  (data, 'error) result Lwt.t

(** [read data ~len ~into:buf buffer ~offset] copies [len] data from the [data] chunk into [buf].
    If [len] is not provided, it copies all the data.
    If [len] is less than the amount of data available, it returns a
    new handler of the remainder.

    - Assumes that [data] has been produced by a {!write} attempt in [buffer].
    - Assumes that [len] is less than [length data].
