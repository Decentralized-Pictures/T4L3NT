(**

   This module implements functional arrays equipped with accessors
   that cannot raise exceptions following the same design principles
   as {!FallbackArray}:

   Reading out of the bounds of the arrays return a fallback value
   fixed at array construction time, writing out of the bounds of the
   arrays is ignored.

   Contrary to {!FallbackArray}, writing generates a fresh array.

   Please notice that this implementation is naive and should only
   be used for small arrays. If there is a need for large functional
   arrays, it is recommended to implement Backer's trick to get
   constant-time reads and writes for sequences of mutations applied
   to the same array.

(** The type for array containing values of type ['a]. *)
type 'a t

(** [make len v] builds an array [a] initializing [len] cells with
   [v]. The value [v] is the fallback value for [a]. *)
val make : int -> 'a -> 'a t

(** [init len v make] builds an array [a] initializing [len] cells
    where the [i]-th cell value is [make i]. The value [v] is the
    fallback value for [a]. *)
val init : int -> 'a -> (int -> 'a) -> 'a t

(** [fallback a] returns the fallback value for [a]. *)
val fallback : 'a t -> 'a

(** [length a] returns the length of [a]. *)
val length : 'a t -> int

(** [get a idx] returns the contents of the cell of index [idx] in
   [a]. If [idx] < 0 or [idx] >= [length a], [get a idx] =
   [fallback a]. *)
val get : 'a t -> int -> 'a

(** [set a idx value] returns a new array identical to [a] except
   that the cell of index [idx] with [value].
   If [idx] < 0 or [idx] >= [length a], returns a copy of [a]. *)
val set : 'a t -> int -> 'a -> 'a t

(** [iter f a] iterates [f] over the cells of [a] from the
   cell indexed [0] to the cell indexed [length a - 1]. *)
val iter : ('a -> unit) -> 'a t -> unit

(** [iteri f a] iterates [f] over the cells of [a] from the
   cell indexed [0] to the cell indexed [length a - 1] passing
   the cell index to [f]. *)
val iteri : (int -> 'a -> unit) -> 'a t -> unit

(** [map a] computes a new array obtained by applying [f] to each
   cell contents of [a]. Notice that the fallback value of the new
   array is [f (fallback a)]. *)
val map : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b t

(** [mapi f a] computes a new array obtained by applying [f] to each
   cell contents of [a] passing the index of this cell to [i].
    Notice that the fallback value of the new array is [f (-1) (fallback a)]. *)
val mapi : (int -> 'a -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b t

(** [fold f a init] traverses [a] from the cell indexed [0] to the
   cell indexed [length a - 1] and transforms [accu] into [f accu x]
   where [x] is the content of the cell under focus. [accu] is
   [init] on the first iteration. *)
val fold : ('b -> 'a -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b -> 'b

(** [fold_map f a init fallback] traverses [a] from the cell indexed
   [0] to the cell indexed [length a - 1] and transforms [accu] into
   [fst (f accu x)] where [x] is the content of the cell under
   focus. [accu] is [init] on the first iteration. The function also
   returns a fresh array containing [snd (f accu x)] for each [x].
   [fallback] is required to initialize a fresh array before it can be
   filled. *)
