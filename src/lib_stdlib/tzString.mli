(** [split delim ~limit str] splits [str] into a list of strings.
    Splitting occurs on [delim] characters (which are removed from output)
    at most [limit] times. Remaining [delim] characters are included in the
    last element of the resulting list.

    [limit] defaults to [max_int].

    This function obeys the invariant that for all [limit]s, [delim]s and [str]s:
    [String.concat (String.init 1 (fun _ -> delim)) (split delim ~limit str) = str].*)
val split : char -> ?limit:int -> string -> string list

(** Splits a string on a delimiter character. It strips delimiters at the
    beginning and at the end. It considers groups of delimiters as one. If
    [limit] is passed, stops after [limit] split(s). [limit] defaults to
    [max_int]. It's guaranteed to never produce empty strings in the output.
    Therefore, it's capable of producing an empty list as a result.

    For example,
    [split_no_empty ',' ",hello,,world,"] returns ["hello"; "world"] *)
