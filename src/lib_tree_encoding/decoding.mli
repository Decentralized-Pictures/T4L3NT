    The [default] labeled argument can be provided to specify a

(** [lazy_mapping to_key decoder] decodes to a function [f] that can
    be called to look up keyed values in the current tree and the
    subtree from where the values are decoded.

    For example, the expression [f k] is virtually equivalent to
    running a decoder like [value (to_key k) decoder] against the tree.

    This function is primarily useful when providing a [~produce_value]
    function to [Lazy_map.create]. *)

    the decoder is actually needed. This is required to allow for directly
    recursive decoders. *)

(** [of_lwt p] lifts the promise [p] into a decoding value. *)

      function [f]. *)

(** [case tag dec f] returns a partial decoder that represents a case in a
    variant type. The decoder hides the (existentially bound) type of the
    parameter to the specific case, provided a converter function [f] and
    base decoder [dec]. *)
val case : 'tag -> 'b t -> ('b -> 'a) -> ('tag, 'a) case

    an [Lwt] value. *)
val case_lwt : 'tag -> 'b t -> ('b -> 'a Lwt.t) -> ('tag, 'a) case

(** [tagged_union ?default tag_dec cases] returns a decoder that use
    [tag_dec] for decoding the value of a field [tag]. The decoder
    searches through the list of cases for a matching branch. When a
    matching branch is found, it uses its embedded decoder for the
    value. This function is used for constructing decoders for
    sum-types.

    [default] is an optional labeled argument that can be provided
    in order to have a fallback to use in case the tag is absent
    from the tree (which means, the value has not yet been
    initialized in the tree).

    If an insufficient list of cases are provided, the resulting encoder may
    fail with a [No_tag_matched] error when [run].  *)
val tagged_union :
  ?default:(unit -> 'a) -> 'tag t -> ('tag, 'a) case list -> 'a t

(** [wrapped_tree] returns the [Tree.wrapped_tree] located at the prefix tree
    under which it is called.

    @raises Key_not_found when the requested key is not present. *)
val wrapped_tree : Tree.wrapped_tree t

(** Syntax module for the {!Tree_decoding}. This is intended to be opened
    locally in functions. Within the scope of this module, the code can
    include binding operators, leading to a [let]-style syntax. Similar to
    {!Lwt_result_syntax} and other syntax modules. *)

  (** [return x] returns a value in the decoding monad. *)
  val return : 'a -> 'a t

  (** [bind m f] monadic composition that decodes using [m] and passes the
      result to [f]. *)
  val bind : 'a t -> ('a -> 'b t) -> 'b t

  (** [both d1 d2] returns a decoder that decodes using [d1] followed by [d2]
      and combines their results. *)
  val both : 'a t -> 'b t -> ('a * 'b) t

  (** [let*] is a binding operator alias for {!bind}. *)
