    a value of type [t] *)

(** Encapsulates parameters required to use the cryptographic primitives
    exported by this module. A value of type [t] contains both initial
    [parameters] and computed values depending on it. *)
type t

(** Because of the shell/protocol separation, cryptographic primitives
   need to be splitted. An interface, called the {!module:Verifier}
   aims to be provided for the economic protocol. The other interface,
   called the {!module:Builder} is for the shell.

    A [Verifier], has hinted by the name, mainly needs to check
   proofs:

    1. A proof that a commitment is valid

    2. A proof that a page is valid

   A technicality is that the economic protocol is able to configure
   those cryptographic primitives via several constants.  Also, an SRS
   (aka trusted setup) is required.

   It is the responsibility of the shell and the protocol to ensure
   that both the [Verifier] and the [Builder] are instantiated with the
   same parameters and use the same trusted setup. *)

type initialisation_parameters

(** [initialisation_parameters_from_files ~g1_path ~g2_path] allows to

   used, they are used with the very same initialisation
   parameters. To ensure this property, an integrity check is run.

   This function can take several seconds to run. *)

(** A polynomial is another representation for a slot. One advantage
     of this representation is that a commitment can be computed from
     a polynomial. A commitment has nice properties:

      1. A commitment ensures that the size of the [slot] has a
     bounded size (typically [slot_size]).

      2. A commitment can be used to verify that a page of fixed size
      (typically [page_size]) is part of the original slot. *)
