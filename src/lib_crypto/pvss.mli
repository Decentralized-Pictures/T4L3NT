    see Schoenmakers, B., 1999:
    A simple publicly verifiable secret sharing scheme
    and its application to electronic voting. Lecture Notes in Computer Science,
    pp.148-164.

    see https://www.win.tue.nl/~berry/papers/crypto99.pdf

    The protocol is expressed as a functor parametrized by a cyclic group
    of prime order. Algebraic properties are enforced at the type level,
    whenever reasonably possible.
