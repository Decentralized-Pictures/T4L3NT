(** [Timelock] is a set of functions to handle time-locking a value and opening
    time-locked values.

    A time-locked value can be opened slowly by anyone doing a fixed number of
    sequential operations.

    In the interface of this module, this fixed number is consistently named
    [time] and is represented by an integer.

    Once opened via the slow method a proof of opening can be produced to avoid
    having to do so again. This proof is verifiable in logarithmic time.

    In order to time-lock an arbitrary sequence of bytes, we
       1. encrypt the bytes with a symmetric key, and then
       2. we time-lock the symmetric key itself.

   This module implements a scheme inspired by:
   Time-lock puzzles and timed release - Rivest, Shamir, Wagner
