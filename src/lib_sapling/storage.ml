    (** Incremental Merkle Tree
     *
     * A tree of height h contains 2^h leaves and h+1 levels of nodes with
     * leaves at level 0 and root at level h.
     *
     * The leaves are commitments and the tree is treated as always filled
     * with a default value H.uncommitted. This allows to have proofs of
     * membership, or witnesses, of fixed size.
     *
     * All the nodes at the same level of an empty tree have the same hash,
     * which can be computed from the default value of the leaves. This is
     * stored in the [uncommitted] list.
     *
     * Any subtree filled with default values is represented by the Empty
     * constructor and given its height it's possible to compute its hash
     * using the [uncommitted] list.
     *
     * The leaves are indexed by their position [pos], ranging from 0 to
     * (2^h)-1. The encoding of [pos] limits the possible size of the tree.
     * In any case the only valid height for the Sapling library is 32, so even
     * if the library encodes positions as uint64, they never exceed uint32.
     *
     * The tree is incremental in the sense that leaves cannot be modified but
     * only added and exclusively in successive positions.
     * The type t contains the size of the tree which is also the next position
     * to fill.
     *
     * Given that elements are added and retrieved by position, it is possible
     * to use this information to efficiently navigate the tree.
     * Given a tree of height [h] and a position [pos], if pos < pow2 (h-1) only
     * the left subtree needs to be inspected recursively. Otherwise only the
     * right needs to be visited, decreasing [pos] by [pow2 (h-1)].
     *
     * In order to avoid storing the height for each subtree (or worse
     * recomputing it), each function with suffix `_height` expects the height
     * of the tree as parameter. These functions are only for internal use and
     * are later aliased by functions using the default height of a Sapling
     * incremental Merkle tree.
