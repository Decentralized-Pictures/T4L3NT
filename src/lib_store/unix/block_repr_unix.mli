open Block_repr

(** Unix-dependent accessors for {!Block_repr}. *)

(** [read_next_block_exn fd] reads from [fd] and decode the next block
   found in the descriptor. The [fd]'s offset is moved as a side
   effect. This returns the decoded block along with the block length
   (number of bytes) of the encoded block. This function updates the
   given [fd] state and may raise Unix.error errors, see Unix.read. *)
val read_next_block_exn : Lwt_unix.file_descr -> (t * int) Lwt.t

(** Same as [read_next_block fd] but returns [None] if there was an
    error. *)
val read_next_block : Lwt_unix.file_descr -> (t * int) option Lwt.t

(** [pread_block_exn fd ~file_offset] reads from [fd] and decode the
   block at offset [file_offset] in the descriptor. This returns the
   decoded block along with the block length (number of bytes) of the
   encoded block. This function may raise Unix.error errors, see
   Unix.read. *)
val pread_block_exn : Lwt_unix.file_descr -> file_offset:int -> (t * int) Lwt.t

(** Same as [pread_block fd ~file_offset] but returns [None] if there
    was an error. *)

(** Unsafe set of functions intended for internal data manipulation.
    Must not be used outside of the [Tezos_store]. *)

(** [prune_raw_block_bytes block_buffer] prunes the block contained in
    [block_buffer] and returns [metadata_offset] such that
    [decode Block_repr.encoding (Bytes.sub block_bytes 0 metadata_offset)]
    is consistent and returns a [Block_repr.t] where [metadata = None]. *)
val prune_raw_block_bytes : bytes -> int

(** [raw_get_block_hash block_buffer] introspects the hash of the
    block contained in [block_buffer]. *)
val raw_get_block_hash : bytes -> Block_hash.t

(** [raw_get_block_level block_buffer] introspects the level of the
    block contained in [block_buffer]. *)
val raw_get_block_level : bytes -> int32

(** [raw_get_block_predecessor block_buffer] introspects the
    predecessor's hash of the block contained in [block_buffer]. *)
val raw_get_block_predecessor : bytes -> Block_hash.t

(** [raw_get_last_allowed_fork_level block_buffer] introspects the
    last allowed fork level of the block's metadata contained in
    [block_buffer] if there is any. Returns [None] if no metadata is
    present. *)
