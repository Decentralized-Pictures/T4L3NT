# tezos-legacy-store
Summary line: Legacy storage library for storing chain data

## Overview
- `tezos-legacy-store` provides the legacy abstraction of the disk
   storage. It aims to handles the on-disk storage of static objects
   such as blocks, operations, block's metadata, protocols and chain
   data.
- This legacy aims to be used in migration test from the legacy store
  and **must not be used for new development**.
