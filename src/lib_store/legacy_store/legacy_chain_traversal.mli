(** [iter_predecessors state blocks f] iter [f] on [blocks] and
    their recursive predecessors. Blocks are visited with a
    decreasing fitness (then decreasing timestamp). If the optional
    argument [max] is provided, the iteration is stopped after [max]
    visited block. If [min_fitness] id provided, blocks with a
    fitness lower than [min_fitness] are ignored. If [min_date],
    blocks with a fitness lower than [min_date] are ignored. *)

    predecessors. And where [operations] is the set of operations
    included in those blocks.
