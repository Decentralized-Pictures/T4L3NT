(** Persistent and cached generic block store

    The store instantiate a cemented block store and multiple floating
    block stores. The floating stores serve as buffers until enough
    blocks have arrived. Then it performs a "cementing" (also
    called a "merge"). Under normal circumstances, there are two
    different kinds ({!Floating_block_store.floating_kind}) of
    floating stores instances: a [RO](read-only) and a
    [RW](read-write). Newly arrived blocks are {b always} pushed in
    the [RW] instance. The block lookup is first tried in [RW], then
    [RO] and finally in the cement blocks.

    This store also instantiates a LRU block cache to reduce the number
    of I/O operations. This cache is updated whenever a block is read
    or stored.

    When a merge occurs, the [RW] instance is promoted as another
    [RO'] and a new [RW'] instance replaces it. This allows retrieving
    the new cycle to be cemented from [RO] and [RO'] (former [RW]) {b
    asynchronously} and thus allowing new blocks to be stored in the
    newly instantiated [RW] store without pausing. This asynchronous
    merging thread, while retrieving the cycle to cement, also
    combines [RO] and [RO'] into a {b new} [RO''] without the cemented
    cycle. When the merging thread is done, the former [RO] and [RO']
    instances are deleted from the disk and the new [RO''] replaces
    them. A merging thread has to wait for the previous one to finish.

    Retrieving the new cycle from [RO] and [RO'] from blocks [B_start]
    and [B_end] means that we must retrieve the set of blocks between
    them but also trim potential branches that have roots in this set.
    To achieve that, we iterate over [RO] and [RO'] {b linearly}. This
    means that {b every block's predecessor in floating stores must be
    previously known}. Either we previously encountered it in the same
    floating store file, either in [RO] if the block is in [RO'] or in
    the cemented store (see invariants below). This invariant is
    required to ensure minimal memory usage. The iterations done to
    retrieve the cycle and merge the floating stores works similarly
    to a {i stop and copy} GC algorithm. It works as follows:

    - We retrieve the blocks from [B_end] to [B_start] by sequentially
      reading predecessors.

    - We instantiate a set of encountered block hashes with [B_end]'s
      hash as initial value.

    - We iterate sequentially over [RO] and [RO'] blocks and copy them
      only if their predecessors is present in the visited set, adding
      their hash in the process.

    The result is a correct, in order and trimmed new [RO] floating
    store. A visual example of merging is given below.

    The merging thread will also trigger a garbage-collection of the
    cemented block store w.r.t. the given history mode.


    {1 Invariants}

    This store is expected to respect the following invariants:

    - If no merging thread is pending, two floating stores are
      present: a [RO] and a [RW].

    - If a merging thread is pending, there are three floating stores
      present: a [RO], a [RO'] and a [RW].

    - Blocks may be stored twice in {b floating stores} but only when
      a merging occurs (as [RO''] is a subset of [RO]+[RO']). However,
      blocks can be present in both the cemented and the floating
      store (after importing a storage snapshot as the floating block
      store consist in a checkpoint associated with its `max_op_ttl`
      blocks which were already cemented).

    - For every stored block in floating stores, its predecessor is
      either already stored in the same floating store file, in a
      previous floating store file or in the cemented store.

    - A merging thread does not start until the previous one has
      completed.

(** {1 Merging example}
{v
           RO          RW

                 | C' - D' - E'   G'
              /  |               /
         A - B - | C - D - E - F - G
                 |  \
                 |    D'' - E''
                 |     \
                 |       E'''
v}

    For instance, a merging from [A] to [C] will first retrieve blocks
    [C], [B] and [A]. Then, iterate over all the blocks in both the
    [RO] and [RW] files: reading first in [RO], then in [RW]. By
    construction, blocks are stored after their predecessors. For
    example, \[ A ; B ; C ; C'; D'' ; D'; D ; E ; E'' ; F ; E''' ; G'
    ; G \] is a valid storing sequence.

    The algorithm starts iterating over this sequence and will only
    copy blocks for which predecessors are present in the set S of
    hash (initially S = \{ hash([C]) \}). Thus, for the given sequence,
    [D''] will first be considered, S will be updated to \{ hash([C]),
    hash([D]) \} and so on, until [RO] and [RW] are fully read.

    The new RO will then be:
{v
                G'
               /
    - D - E - F - G

    - D'' - E''
       \
        E'''
v}
    where its storing order will be correct with regards to the
    invariant.
