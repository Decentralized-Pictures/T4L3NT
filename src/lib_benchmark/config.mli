(** This module implements a schema for a json file that contains the
    configuration for all the benchmarks registered in Snoop.
    This configuration file has a tree-like structure that follows the Namespace
    hierarchy of the benchmarks. Its root element is always ".". *)

(** Its encoding *)

(** Print [t] in JSON *)

(** The minimal config file *)

(** Build [t] from the given bindings *)
val build : (Namespace.t * Data_encoding.json) list -> t

(** Given a benchmark [b] and a config [c], [get_config b c] returns the
    configuration for the benchmark [b] stored in [c], in json form. *)
val get_config : Benchmark.t -> t -> Data_encoding.json

(** Given a benchmark [b] and a file path [p], [parse_config b (Some p)]
    returns the configuration for the benchmark [b] stored in the configuration
    file located in path [p]. And [parse_config b None] returns the default
    configuration for [b] instead.
    If [print] is specified, the configuration is printed out in [print].
    Otherwise nothing is printed *)

    paths [dst] and [src], in [dst]. If case of conflict, [src] overwrites [dst].

      - [`Stdin], reading from the standard input (default)
      - [`String s], parsing a string as a Json document
      - [`File f], using a Json file at path [f]
      - [`Edit e], using the given text editor [e]
