(** Helpers to read JSON values.

    Contains functions to parse JSON values, show them for debugging, and
    extract information from them.

    Functions which extract information are rather strict: they don't try
    to be smart and automatically convert. For instance, [as_record] makes sure
    that all fields are taken into account. This is suited to write a tool that
    must be updated when the format of JSON values being manipulated changes.
    In our case, if the JSON schemas we read start to get more fields, we want
    to know; otherwise the resulting OpenAPI specification could be inaccurate. *)
