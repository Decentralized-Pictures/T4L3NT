(** [connect ?timeout addr] tries connecting to [addr] and returns
    the resulting socket file descriptor on success. When using TCP,
    [Unix.getaddrinfo] is used to resolve the hostname and service
    (port). The different socket addresses returned by
    [Unix.getaddrinfo] are tried sequentially, and the [?timeout]
    argument (default: 5s) governs how long it waits to get a
    connection. If a connection is not obtained in less than
    [?timeout], the connection is canceled and and the next socket
    address (if it exists) is tried. *)
