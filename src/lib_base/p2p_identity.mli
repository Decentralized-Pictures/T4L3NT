    work stamp difficulty is at least equal to [pow_target].

    The optional argument [max] sets a maximum number of attempts. If that many
    attempts are made without finding a successful pow, the function fails with

    NOTICE: This function is meant for generating dummy identities. It is useful
    for tests and other such controlled environment but it is not suitable for
    generating identities for an open network. *)
