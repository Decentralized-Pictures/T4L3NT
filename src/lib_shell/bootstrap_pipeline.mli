(** The bootstrap pipeline works as follows:
    1. From a locator, it computes a list of subchains (identified by
       a [Block_locator.step]) to fetch.
    2. A worker starts to fetch all the headers (top to bottom) from a subchain,
       starting with the top subchain.
    3. A worker starts to download the list of operations by batch of blocks
       once a batch of headers is available.
    4. A worker validates blocks one by one (bottom to top).

    These three workers work concurrently.

    operation.
