    from a given type to another. *)

(** [sync f] is the function [f] as a synchronous step. Data that is transformed
    by a synchronous function is never buffered. Instead it is transformed as it
    arrives. *)
val sync : ('a -> 'b) -> ('a, 'b) step

(** [async_s f] is the function [f] as an asynchronous serial step. There is
    only ever at most one unresolved promise created by this function. If data
    arrives at this step and the function as already been called, the data is
    buffered until the promise created by the call resolves. *)
val async_s : ('a -> 'b Lwt.t) -> ('a, 'b) step

(** [async_p f] is the function [f] as an asynchronous parallel step. Multiple
    unresolved promise for this step can be unresolved at the same time. Data
    might still be buffered if the global limit on unresolved promises is
    reached. *)

    available data into the [result] type. *)

val with_err :

    [Error] data onto the same type as the [Ok] data and exits the [result]
    type. *)

(** Core functionality:
    [run ?pool pipe input] runs all the elements of [input] through the steps of
    [pipeline]. All the while it maintains the following invariants:
    - There are never more than [pool] unresolved high-level promises at any one
    time. A high-level promise is one that corresponds to a call to one of the
    step function. (Note that each such promise can create additional promises
    which are not limited by the [pool] parameter of [run].) By default, impose
    no limits at all.
    - The elements maintain the same ordering all throughout the pipeline. In
    other words, if [x] is before [y] in [input], then for any step [s], the
    high-level promise of [s] for [x] will be created before the high-level
    promise of [s] for [y].
