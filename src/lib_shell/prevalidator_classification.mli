(** Invariants ensured by this module **provided that the caller does
    not {!add} an operation which is already present in [t]**:
    - The field [in_mempool] is the set of all operation hashes present
      in fields: [refused; branch_refused; branch_delayed; applied].
    - An operation cannot be at the same time in two of the following
      fields: [refused; branch_refused; branch_delayed; applied].

    Note: We could always enforce these invariants by checking in {!add}
    whether the operation is already present. However, this would make
    the behavior of {!add} less predictable, so we do not think this to
    be an improvement from the point of view of the caller. *)

}

(** [create parameters] returns an empty {!t} whose bounded maps hold
    at most [parameters.map_size_limit] values. The
    [on_discarded_operation] is called when a new operation is added
    and an old one is discarded because the limit was reached.

    {!Invalid_argument} is raised if [ring_size] is [0] or less.
    *)
val create : parameters -> t

(** [flush classes ~handle_branch_refused] partially resets [classes]:
    - fields [applied_rev] and [branch_delayed] are emptied;
    - field [branch_refused] is emptied iff [handle_branch_refused] is [true];
    - field [refused] is left unchanged, to avoid revalidating operations that
      will never be valid.
    Also updates field [in_mempool] to maintain the corresponding invariant
    of {!t}. *)
val flush : t -> handle_branch_refused:bool -> unit

(** [is_in_mempool oph classes] indicates whether [oph] is present
    in field [in_mempool] of [classes]. *)
val is_in_mempool : Operation_hash.t -> t -> bool

(** [is_applied oph classes] indicates whether [oph] is present
    in field [applied_rev] of [classes]. *)
val is_applied : Operation_hash.t -> t -> bool

(** [remove oph classes] removes operation of hash [oph] from all
    fields of [classes].

    {b Warning:} If an operation is removed from the [applied] field,
    this may invalidate the classification of all the other
    operations. It is left to the caller to restore a consistent
    state. *)
val remove : Operation_hash.t -> t -> unit

(** [add ~notify classification oph op classes] adds the operation [op] with
    hash [oph] classified as [classification] to the classifier [classes]. The
    [classes.parameters.on_discarded_operation] callback is called for any operation discarded in this
    process. Currently, an operation is discarded in the following cases:

    - the corresponding error class field is full. In that case, the new operation is added to the class, and the removed one is discarded.
    - an operation is classified as [Refused].

    Note that a [Refused] operation may thus be passed twice to [on_discarded_operation]: as soon as it is added, and if it is removed because the [classes.refused] bounded map is full.

    As a summary:

    - [Applied] is never discarded
    - [Branch_refused] and [Branch_delayed] are discarded 0 or 1 time (if the corresponding bounded_map is full)
    - [Refused] is discarded 1 or 2 times (if the corresponding bounded_map is full)

    [notify] is called at the very beginning of [add]. Its goal is to remind call sites that classifying an operation should send a notification somewhere. Its presence in this API is arguable, and may change/move in the future. *)

(** [map applied branch_delayed branch_refused refused t]
