      an association list mapping listening addresses (in string literal forms)
      to deny/access access policies. *)

  (** Default ACL policy in case none is defined in configuration. It only
      exposes such endpoints that are necessary for the node to allow clients to
      make use of their Tez. It applies to all listening addresses except for
      [localhost] (see {!allow_all} for this address). *)

      it's better to use [default] rather than this value. It's mainly intended

      An ACL is considered matching if its corresponding IP part matches the IP
      part of the [address] and either:
      - its corresponding port also matches [address]'s port OR
      - its corresponding address does not mention any port at all.

      The first ACL whose corresponding address matches these criteria is
      returned. *)

      they resolve to.

      [resolve_domain_names p] returns a policy equivalent to [p] but with all
      domain-name addresses resolved to IPs. This is useful to make it easier
      to match them with listening addresses given to the server. *)
