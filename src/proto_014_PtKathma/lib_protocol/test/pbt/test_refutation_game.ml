 `genlist` is a `correct list` generator. It generates a list of strings that
  are either integers or `+` to be consumed by the arithmetic PVM.
  If a `+` is found then the previous two element of the stack are poped
   then added and the result is pushed to the stack.
   In particular, lists like `[1 +]` are incorrect.

  To preserve the correctness invariant, genlist is a recursive generator that
  produce a pair `(stack_size, state_list)` where  state_list is a correct list
  of integers and `+` and consuming it will produce a `stack` of length
  `stack_size`.
  For example a result can be `(3, [1; 2; +; 3; +; 2; 2; +; 1;]).
  Consuming the list will produce the stack`[6; 4; 2]` which has length 3.
  The generator has two branches.
  1. with frequency 1 adds integers to state_list and increases the
  corresponding stack_size.
  2. With frequency 2, at each step, it looks at the inductive result
  `(self (n - 1))=(stack_size, state_list)`.
  If the stack_size is smaller than 2 then it adds an integer to the state_list
   and increases the stack_size
  Otherwise it adds a plus to the state_list and decreases the stack_size.
  Remark: The algorithm is linear in the size of the generated list and
  generates all kinds of inputs not only those that produce a stack of size 1.
