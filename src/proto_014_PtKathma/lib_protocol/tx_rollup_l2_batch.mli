open Tx_rollup_l2_context_sig

(** This module introduces the batches of transactions that the
    layer-2 (1) reads from its inboxes (see
    {!Tx_rollup_message_repr.Batch}), and (2) interprets off-chain.

    One of the main concerns of the transaction rollups is to provide
    a high-throughput to its participants. That is, transaction
    rollups are expected to be able to process a significant number of
    operations “per second.”

    Putting aside the computational power required by the rollup node,
    the main limit to the throughput of a transaction rollup is the
    number of operations that can fit in a Tezos block. As such, the
    number of bytes that are necessary to store the batches is of key
    importance.

    To estimate the theoretical maximum throughput of the transaction
    rollups as a feature, we can use the following methodology:

    {ul {li Determine the number of bytes that can be allocated to
            layer-2 batches in a Tezos block, under the hypothesis
            that only layer-2 batch submissions and the
            consensus-related operations are included in said
            block. Ideally, this needs to take into account the
            limitation of the size of a layer-2 batch imposed by the
            layer-1 protocol, and the size of the signature that comes
            with an individual batch.}
        {li Divide this number by the average size of a layer-2
            operation, this gives an estimate of the maximum layer-2
            operations per block.}
        {li Divide again the result by the average time (in seconds)
            between two Tezos blocks; the result is the theoretical
            maximum number of operations per second the transaction
            rollups allow to process.}}

   That is, there is three parameters that decide the throughput of
   transaction rollups, and the average size of an operation is the
   only one under the control of the layer-2 implementation.
   Henceforth, both the definitions of types of this module and the
   implementation of their encodings have been carefully crafted in
   order to allow for compact batches. *)

      The first byte of the resulting binary array is used to encode
      the size of lists of less than 254 elements. For larger lists,

      which consumes eight bytes. *)

  val transaction_encoding :

  (** A specialized, space-efficient encoding for [operation].

      The first byte of the binary output describes precisely the layout
      of the encoded value.

      Considering the tag [ooooccss], [ss] describes the format of
      [signer], [cc] of [counter] and [oooo] of [contents].

      More precisely, for [signer],

      {ul {li [00] means an index fitting on 1 byte.}
          {li [01] means an index fitting on 2 bytes.}
          {li [10] means an index fitting on 4 bytes.}
          {li [11] means a value of type {!Bls_signature.pk}.}}

      The [counter] field follows a similar logic,

      {ul {li [00] means an index fitting on 1 byte.}
          {li [01] means an index fitting on 2 bytes.}
          {li [10] means an index fitting on 4 bytes.}
          {li [11] means an integer fitting on 8 bytes.}
      }

      Finally, the [contents] field follows this pattern

      {ul {li From [0000] to [1110], the tag encodes the size of the
              list of [operation_content], {i e.g.}, [0010] means that
              there is two elements in [contents].}
          {li [1111] means that [contents] is prefixed by its number
              of elements.}
      } *)
  val compact_operation :
    (Indexable.unknown, Indexable.unknown) operation Data_encoding.Compact.t

  (** A specialized, space-efficient encoding for [operation_content].

      The first byte of the binary output describes precisely the layout
      of the encoded value.

      Considering the tag [0qqttddd], [ddd] describes the format of
      [destination], [tt] of [ticket_hash] and [qq] of [qty]. More
      precisely, for [destination],

      {ul {li [000] means a layer-1 address.}
          {li [100] means an index for a layer-2 address, fitting on 1 byte.}
          {li [101] means an index for a layer-2 address, fitting on 2 bytes.}
          {li [110] means an index for a layer-2 address, fitting on 4 bytes.}
          {li [111] means a value (of type {!Tx_rollup_l2_address.t},
              that is a layer-2 address.}
      }

      The [ticket_hash] is encoded using this logic:

      {ul {li [00] means an index for a ticket hash, fitting on 1 byte.}
          {li [01] means an index for a ticket hash, fitting on 2 bytes.}
          {li [10] means an index for a ticket hash, fitting on 4 bytes.}
          {li [11] means a value (of type {!Ticket_hash.t}.}
      }

      The [qty] field follows a similar logic,

      {ul {li [00] means an integer fitting on 1 byte.}
          {li [01] means an integer fitting on 2 bytes.}
          {li [10] means an integer fitting on 4 bytes.}
          {li [11] means an integer fitting on 8 bytes.}
      }

      If used to read, respectively write, a value where the
      the [destination] is a layer-1 address and the ticket_hash is an
      index, which is not allowed by the layer-2 protocol, then a

       - [Data_encoding.Binary.Read_error (Exception_raised_in_user_function ...)],

      respectively

       - [Data_encoding.Binary.Write_error (Exception_raised_in_user_function ...)]

      exception is raised.
