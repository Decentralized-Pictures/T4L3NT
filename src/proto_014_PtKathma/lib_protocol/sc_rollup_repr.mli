(** The basic components of an optimistic rollup for smart-contracts. *)

(**

   An optimistic rollup for smart-contracts is made of two main
   components:

   - a proof generating virtual machine (PVM), which provides the
   essential semantics for the rollup operations to be validated by
   the layer 1 in case of dispute about a commitment ;

   - a database which maintains the cemented operations of the rollup
   as well as the potentially-disputed operations.

*)

(** A smart-contract rollup has an address starting with "scr1". *)
module Address : sig
  include S.HASH

  (** [from_nonce nonce] produces an address completely determined by
     an operation hash and an origination counter. *)
  val from_nonce : Origination_nonce.t -> t tzresult

  (** [encoded_size] is the number of bytes needed to represent an address. *)
  val encoded_size : int

  val of_b58data : Base58.data -> t option

  (** [prefix] is the prefix of smart contract rollup addresses. *)
  val prefix : string
end

module Internal_for_tests : sig
  val originated_sc_rollup : Origination_nonce.t -> Address.t
end

module State_hash : S.HASH

(** Number of messages consumed by a single commitment. This represents a claim
    about the shape of the Inbox, which can be disputed as part of a commitment
    dispute.

    See also {!Commitment_repr.}. *)
module Number_of_messages : Bounded.Int32.S

(** Number of ticks computed by a single commitment. This represents a claim
    about the state of the PVM, which can be disputed as part of a commitment
    dispute.

    See also {!Commitment_repr.}. *)
module Number_of_ticks : Bounded.Int32.S

(** A smart contract rollup is identified by its address. *)
type t = Address.t

val encoding : t Data_encoding.t

val rpc_arg : t RPC_arg.t

val pp : Format.formatter -> t -> unit

(** [in_memory_size sc_rollup] returns the number of bytes [sc_rollup]
    uses in RAM. *)
val in_memory_size : t -> Cache_memory_helpers.sint

(** A [Staker] is an implicit account, identified by its public key hash. *)
module Staker :
  S.SIGNATURE_PUBLIC_KEY_HASH with type t = Signature.Public_key_hash.t

(** The data model uses an index of these addresses. *)
module Index : Storage_description.INDEX with type t = Address.t
