    If [fmt_opt] is [Some _], then it formats the value returned by
    [for_script ()]. The function's return value is formatted as lines of
    columns of values (list of lists of strings). This is to help scripts to
    decode/interpret/parse the output.
    Otherwise, if [fmt_opt] is [None], it calls [for_human ()] which is
    responsible for the whole formatting.

    The optional argument [channel] is used when automatically formatting the
    value returned by [for_script ()]. It has no effect on [for_human ()]. *)
