(** An implementation of {!Tezos_base.Internal_event.SINK} which
    writes the events as JSON files in a given directory structure.

    It is registered with the URI scheme ["unix-files"], one can activate it
    with an URI containing the top-level directory in which the JSON
    files will be written, e.g.
    ["export TEZOS_EVENTS_CONFIG=unix-files:///the/path/to/write"]
    (the path should be inexistent or already a directory).

    The directory structure is as follows:
    ["<section-dirname>/<event-name>/<YYYYMMDD-string>/<HHMMSS-MMMMMM>/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-MMMMMM-xxxx.json>"]
    where ["<section-dirname>"] is either ["no-section"] or
    ["section-<section-name>"].
