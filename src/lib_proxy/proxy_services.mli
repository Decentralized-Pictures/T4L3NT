(** Exception used by the proxy mode when creation of the input environment
    (of the RPC handler) fails. This exception is used to temporarily escape
    from the monad, because at the point of throwing, the code is NOT in
    [tzresult Lwt.t]. As it's dealing with resto APIs it's in an [Lwt.t]-only
    monad. This exception is injected back in the tzresult [Lwt.t] monad at the
    point where it is caught (with [Lwt.catch]). *)

(** Whether using the light mode or the proxy mode (remember that
    the light mode is a different instance of the proxy mode
    (see srcs/lib_proxy/README_LIGHT.md for documentation)
    and whether [tezos-client] or [tezos-proxy-server] is running. *)

          is the value of argument [--sym-block-caching-time]. The
          [(Context_hash.t -> Proxy_delegate.t tzresult Lwt.t) option]
          value is constructed from argument [--data-dir]: if the argument
          is present, this value represents how data is looked up in the
          data-dir of a running node. *)

(** [build_directory printer rpc_context env mode] returns the directory
    of RPCs that is served locally by the client's light and proxy modes and
    by the proxy server. Parameters are:

    - [printer] is used for logging.
    - [rpc_context] is used to perform RPCs to distant endpoints.
    - [mode] specifies whether [tezos-client] (light or proxy mode)
      or [tezos-proxy-server] is running.
    - [env] is a protocol-specific module used to create the context passed when executing a RPC. *)
