(** Multiple operations can be grouped in one ensuring their
    derministic application.

    If an invalid operation is present in this group of operation, the
    previous applied operations are backtracked leaving the context
    unchanged and the following operations are skipped. Fees attributed
    to the operations are collected by the baker nonetheless.

    Only manager operations are allowed in multiple transactions.
    They must all belong to the same manager as there is only one signature. *)
