      operations and add them to the block. Otherwise, provided
      operations will be used. In both cases, they will be validated.

    * Baking priority: If [`Auto] is used, it will be computed from
      the public key hash of the specified contract, optionally capped
      to a maximum value, and optionally restricting for free baking slot.

    * Timestamp: If [?timestamp] is set, and is compatible with the
      computed baking priority, it will be used. Otherwise, it will be
      set at the best baking priority.

    * Fee Threshold: If [?fee_threshold] is given, operations with fees lower than it
      are not added to the block.
