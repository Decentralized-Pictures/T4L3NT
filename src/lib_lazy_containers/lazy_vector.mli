  A lazy vector is a fixed-size key-value association where each value is
  created dynamically.

  In many ways this data structure mimics an array, but its lookup has
  logarithmic time complexity and it supports non-int keys.

(** [KeyS] is the qualifier signature for key types in the lazy vector.
    Externally visible and accessible keys of the lazy vector are always
    non-negative. However, the lazy vector implementation may internally use
    negative keys therefore modules of type [KeyS] must support them.
