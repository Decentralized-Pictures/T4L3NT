(** The [SCORE] module type describes primitives used to update the scores
    associated to each peer. Score computation is described in more details in
    {{: https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pubsub/gossipsub/gossipsub-v1.1.md#peer-scoring }the specification}.

    The score associated to a peer is a weighted sum of various counters, some
    of which are indexed by topics. Each captures a certain aspect of what a
    well-behaving peer should do. A short description follows, keeping the
    naming P1, P2, ... used in the specification.

    - P1: For each topic, we measure how long a peer has spent in the mesh for that topic. The longest, the better.
    - P2: For each topic, we measure how many times the peer was the first among all peers to send us a message on that topic.
    - P3: For each topic, we measure the number of message deliveries. If the number is below a threshold,
      we penalize the associated peer.
    - P3b: Trigger P3 computation when the peer gets pruned or removed, so as to not forget yet unaccounted for bad message
      delivery counts.
    - P4: For each topic, penalize peers sending invalid messages on that topic.
    - P5: The applicative layer can assign an arbitrary application-specific score to a peer.
    - P7: When a peer is pruned from the mesh for a topic, we install a backoff that
      prevents that peer from regrafting too soon. If the peer does not respect this backoff,
      it is penalized.
