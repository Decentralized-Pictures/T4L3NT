      mirror.

      Trees are immutable and non-persistent (they disappear if the
      host crash), held in memory for efficiency, where reads are done
      lazily and writes are done only when needed, e.g. on
      [Context.commit]. If a key is modified twice, only the last
      value will be written to disk on commit. *)
