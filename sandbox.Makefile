# The following rules define how to build Tezos binaries if they are
# missing.
#
# We only run "dune build" if it is strictly necessary.  The CI stores
# the binaries as artefacts, but not _build.  Those rules allow us to
# use these artefacts.  Systematically running dune would cause a full
# rebuild since _build is not an artefact.
#
# The drawback of writing the rules this way is that if we need
# several binaries, we call dune several times, which takes a bit
# longer than calling it only once (dune scans the whole repository
# first).
#
# The real drawback of writing the rules this way is that during
# development, if you change something in the sources, as the binaries
# exist, nothing is recompiled!

# The following rules define how to run sandbox (i.e. Flextesa) integration tests.

# Those rules are directly translated from src/bin_sandbox/dune rules.
