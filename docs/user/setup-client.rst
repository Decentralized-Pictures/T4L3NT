Setting up the client
======================

A client in the Tezos network provides different configuration possibilities:

- Key management: configured how keys are managed, with different security tradeoffs.
- Running modes: different running modes, beside the default mode, are intended to facilitate testing applications on smaller or fake networks, for example by executing some RPCs locally, without sending requests to a Tezos node.

These configuration possibilities are described in the following pages.
