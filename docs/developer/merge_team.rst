Merge Team
==========

The merge team is a `group of developers
<https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/project_members>`_
from different teams of the
Tezos ecosystem that controls what is merged into the
https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/ repository.
They are automatically selected as approvers when you create a merge
request.

The general policy is to assure that at least two members of the merge
team have looked at an MR, typically one would approve and another
would merge.
Simple MRs can be merged by a single reviewer.
