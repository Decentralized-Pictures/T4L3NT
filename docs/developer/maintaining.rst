Maintaining
===========

As with any smart-contract blockchain platform, Octez is a quite complex software system, at the crossroad of several domains including distributed systems, cryptography, programming languages, and applied formal methods.
Additionally, the specific evolution features of Tezos, enabling powerful online governance, imply an extra infrastructure meta-layer and an orthogonal versioning scheme for protocols, and hence, more complex maintenance procedures.

The following howtos are intended to facilitate different maintenance tasks by providing detailed guides to core developers and other actors in the ecosystem (communication, management, etc.).
