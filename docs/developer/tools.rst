Core Development tools
======================

The development and maintenance process of the Octez code base is facilitated by some specialized tools.
Some of these tools are included in the Octez code base, because of a close coupling with the code itself (see :doc:`repository_scope` for the policy of selecting such tools).
They provide, for example, support for profiling or for benchmarking different subsystems of Octez.

The tools for core developers are documented in the following pages.
