Welcome to the Tezos Developer Documentation!
=============================================

The Project
-----------

Tezos is a distributed consensus platform with meta-consensus
capability. Tezos not only comes to consensus about the state of its ledger,
like Bitcoin or Ethereum. It also attempts to come to consensus about how the
protocol and the nodes should adapt and upgrade.

 - Developer documentation is available online at https://tezos.gitlab.io/
   and is automatically generated from the master branch.
 - The website https://tezos.com/ contains more information about the project.
 - All development happens on GitLab at https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos

The source code of Tezos is placed under the MIT Open Source License.

Latest Release
--------------

The current version of Tezos is :ref:`version-7`.

The Community
-------------

- The website of the `Tezos Foundation <https://tezos.foundation/>`_.
- `Tezos sub-reddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/tezos/>`_ is an
  important meeting point of the community.

The Networks
------------

Mainnet
~~~~~~~

The Tezos network is the current incarnation of the Tezos blockchain.
It runs with real tez that have been allocated to the
donors of July 2017 ICO (see :ref:`activate_fundraiser_account`).

The Tezos network has been live and open since June 30th 2018.

All the instructions in this documentation are valid for Mainnet
however we **strongly** encourage users to first try all the
introduction tutorials on some :ref:`test network <test-networks>` to familiarize themselves without
risks.

Test Networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several test networks for the Tezos blockchain with a
faucet to obtain free tez (see :ref:`faucet`).
It is the reference network for developers wanting to test their
software before going to beta and for users who want to familiarize
themselves with Tezos before using their real tez.

See the list of test networks in :ref:`test network <test-networks>`.

Getting started
---------------

The best place to start exploring the project is following the How Tos
