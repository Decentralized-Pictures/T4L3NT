Mainnet September 2019
======================

**This release contains the patch necessary to correctly activate protocol Babylon.**

During the testing phase of protocol 005_PsBABY5H, a bug was
identified (more details in the :ref:`005-bigmap-bug`).
The tezos-node in this release contains a corrected version of
Babylon, protocol 005_PsBabyM1, that will be activated in place of
005_PsBABY5H if the promotion vote is successful.

Any node running the May release, in case of a successful promotion
vote, will activate protocol 005_PsBABY5H, which contains a bug
affecting bigmaps in smart contracts.

**We advise users to update to this release so that the corrected protocol 005_PsBabyM1 will be activated.**

In case of a negative promotion vote, any release of the tezos-node
will simply proceed to a new proposal phase.
