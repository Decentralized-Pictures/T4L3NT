Version 17.0~beta1
==================

.. warning::

   For now, this is a ``beta`` version, it is not intended to be the stable version for Octez v17.0. Please use it only on testnets, such as ghostnet or nairobinet.
   Please check :doc:`the release system documentation<./releases>` for more information.

Version 17.0 contains a new version (V9) of the protocol environment,
which is the set of functions that a protocol can call. This new version is used by protocol :doc:`Nairobi<../protocols/017_nairobi>`,
which is a proposal for the successor of Mumbai. This release also
contains Nairobi itself as well as its associated protocol-specific executable binaries (baker, accuser, etc).

The Smart Rollup executables first introduced with Octez v16.0 have been significantly improved, and thus they are no longer intended "for experimental usage only" on Tezos Mainnet.
Note that, as all the other protocol dependent executables, the Smart rollup node and client executables have different versions for Mumbai and Nairobi.

Octez v17 includes a significant improvement of Octez node logging output.
The node now outputs less verbose and clearer logs.
Only essential information is displayed, while a more detailed log is written to disk in the background.
More details can be found in a recent `blog post <https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/introducing-new-octez-node-logs-for-better-ux.html>`_, and in the :doc:`Logging <../user/logging>` entry.
