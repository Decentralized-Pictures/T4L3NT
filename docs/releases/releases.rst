Release system
==============

Tezos releases include all the software needed to run the distributed
consensus platform with its meta-consensus capability. This
meta-consensus capability is supported by a protocol that is used to
achieve consensus not only about the state of its ledger, but also about
upgrading the protocol itself, subject to an on-chain voting procedure.
This evolving nature of the protocol implies that at each point there
are several important protocols, including a currently active protocol
(on the main Tezos network) and other protocols under test, development,
or being voted on-chain. Thus, protocols are versioned independently
from releases (see :doc:`../protocols/naming`). For more details on
the distinction between the protocol and the rest of the Tezos node
software, see :doc:`../shell/the_big_picture`.

Although a Tezos node is able to compile and upgrade to a new protocol
on the fly, each release contains several embedded protocol versions.
Consequently, Tezos releases are created not only when new features are
added or bugs are fixed, but also when new protocols are proposed or
adopted.

Starting with version 7.0, releases are named using a
``<major>.<minor>`` numbering scheme. There are also release candidates
suffixed by ``~rc<N>``.

Releases are available in several forms:

-  in source form, from the Tezos code repository
   (https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos). Tags for each release are available
   prefixed by ``v``, and there is also a ``latest-release`` tag, pointing to
   the latest **stable release** (i.e., excluding release candidates).
   Additionally, the version under development is available in the
   ``master`` branch.
-  packaged in various forms: as standalone binaries (with no dependencies),
   as binary or source packages, and as Docker containers.

The packaged forms are updated from the source form as follows:

-  static binaries:

   -  automatically, at each stable release
   -  For recent release candidates, the static binaries are available
      as GitLab artifacts, pointed to in the `release page of the repository <https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/releases>`_.

-  Docker containers: two kinds of images are generated, automatically:

   -  release images: at each release, including release candidates

   -  master images: at each merge commit (i.e.Â after each merge request is merged)

-  OPAM packages:

   -  at each stable release
   -  This is currently a manual process performed by
      `Nomadic Labs <https://nomadic-labs.com>`_.

-  APT and DNF binary packages:

   -  at each stable release
   -  The process is currently performed manually by
      `Serokell <https://serokell.io>`_ when the OPAM packages
      above are generated.

For installing Tezos from these different forms of releases, see
:doc:`../introduction/howtoget`.
