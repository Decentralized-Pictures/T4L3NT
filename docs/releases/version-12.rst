Version 12.4
============

Version 12.0 contains a new version (V4) of the protocol environment,
which is the set of functions that protocols can call. This new
version is used by protocol Ithaca, which is a proposal for the
successor of Hangzhou. This release candidate also contains Ithaca
itself as well as its daemons (baker and accuser â€” there is no
endorser for Ithaca) and the ``ithacanet`` built-in network alias
for the Ithacanet test network.

The second release candidate (12.0~rc2) replaced protocol Ithaca
(``PsiThaCa``) with Ithaca2 (``Psithaca2``) and updated the
``ithacanet`` built-in network alias to the new version of Ithacanet,
which uses protocol Ithaca2 instead of Ithaca. This second release
candidate also included a number of bug fixes and improvements related
to Ithaca and to the storage backend.

Version 12.1 fixes a case where the baker could crash.
It also updates RPC ``selected_snapshot`` by adding an optional parameter,
useful in particular for indexers aiming to support Ithaca.
Warning: using version 12.1 also automatically upgrades the version
of the storage backend; as a consequence, your data directory will no longer be
usable with older versions of Octez.

Version 12.2 increased the size limit for stored metadata and made
it configurable.

Version 12.3 fixed some remaining issues related to the storage of metadata.
**Breaking change:** note that snapshots exported using v12.3 cannot be
imported by nodes running previous versions of Octez.

Version 12.4 fixed a memory leak in the accuser and the baker.

Update Instructions
-------------------

To update from sources::

  git fetch
  git checkout v12.4
  rm -rf _opam _build
  make build-deps
  eval $(opam env)
  make

If you are using Docker instead, use the ``v12.4`` Docker images of Tezos.

**NB** The `Ithaca2 <../protocols/012_ithaca.html>`_ protocol adopts
the new `Tenderbake <../protocols/tenderbake.html#daemons>`_ consensus
algorithm, which no longer requires a separate *endorser* daemon. This
functionality is now integrated into the *baker* daemons:
``tezos-baker-012-Psithaca`` for Ithaca2 and, respectively,
``tezos-baker-alpha`` for `protocol Alpha <../protocols/alpha.html>`_.
