This directory contains various utility scripts related to the project lifecycle.

# Overview

In particular, this includes scripts for:
* installing the project environment (`install_*.sh`)
* setting up environment variables for building or using Tezos (`env.sh`)
* generating the Docker image used by the CI (`create_docker_image.sh`, `ci/`)
  or used by users and developers (`docker/`)
* dune files instrumentation for computing test coverage (`instrument_dune_bisect.sh`)
* maintaining a custom opam repository with all Tezos dependencies
 (`update_opam_repo.sh`, `opam-*.sh`)
* generate base58 prefixes (`b58_prefix/`)
* generate configuration code (in OCaml) to bootstrap a new network (`gen-genesis/`)
* running quick checks as a git hook before commiting (`pre_commit/`)
* preparing the environment for migration tests (`prepare_migration_test.ml`)
* releasing static Octez binaries (`release/`)
* snapshotting protocols, linking them to the build system (`snapshot_alpha.sh`, `link_protocol.sh`, `snapshot_alpha_and_link.sh`)
* getting baker version stats from a range of blocks (`baker-version-stats.sh`)
* printing a dependency tree based on ocamldep output (`ocamldot.py`)
* creating a yes-wallet, to be used in conjunction with a yes-node (`yes-wallet/` and `yes-node.patch`)
* setting user-activated upgrades (`user_activated_upgrade.sh`)
* generating commitments (initial accounts) for test networks (`create_genesis/create_genesis_info.py`)
* [obsolete] re-computing and updating the hashes of the genesis and alpha protocols (`update_hashes.sh`)

This directory also includes an example docker-compose file to run a node
with a baker and an accuser (`docker/docker-compose-generic.yml`).

## API
<!-- For each script where this is possible, indicate how to obtain usage info
  (e.g. invoke with no args; or link to doc page where the tool is explained), and
  maybe an example of use. -->
