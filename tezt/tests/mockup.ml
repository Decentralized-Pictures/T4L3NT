(* Testing
   -------
   Component: Client - mockup mode
   Invocation: dune exec tezt/tests/main.exe -- --file mockup.ml
   Subject: Unexhaustive tests of the client's --mode mockup. Unexhaustive,
            because most tests of the mockup are written with the python
            framework for now. It was important, though, to provide the
            mockup's API in tezt; for other tests that use the mockup.
