   Component:    Testnet dictator key
   Invocation:   dune exec tezt/tests/main.exe -- --file ghostnet_dictator_migration.ml
   Subject:      This tests that the migration from J to K on a chain whose
                 id is the one of Ghostsnet sets the contant `testnet_dictator`
                 to the expected value (i.e. a Oxhead alpha key).

                 This also test than any other migration, leave the constant
                 unset, especialy on mainnet.
