(* This tests aims to detect a double baking evidence with an accuser.
   The scenario is the following:

   1. Node 1 activates a protocol,

   2. Node 2 catches up with Node 1,

   3. Node 2 is terminated. Then, Node 1 bakes two blocks from level 1
      with bootstrap1 key,

   4. Node 1 is terminated. Then, Node 2 is restarted and bakes two
      blocks from level 1; the first one with the bootstrap2 key and
      the second one with the bootstrap1 key. Thus, the block at level
      3 is double baked (and we ensure that the double baked blocks
      are different as they emanate from two distinct branches),

   5. Node 1 came back in the dance,

   6. Node 3 is run along with its accuser and catches up. The accuser
      must detect the double baking evidence and generate an operation
      accordingly,

   7. A block is baked.

   The test is successful if the double baking evidence can be found
   in the last baked block. *)
