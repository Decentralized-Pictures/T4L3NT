(** RPC description type and functions to call RPCs. *)

(** HTTP request methods. *)
type verb = Client.meth = GET | PUT | POST | PATCH | DELETE

(** RPC descriptions.

    ['endpoint] is the type the target endpoint.
    ['result] is the type of values returned by the RPC after decoding. *)
type ('endpoint, 'result) t

(** Make an RPC description.

    Usage: [make ~get_host ~get_port verb path decode]

    - If [data] is specified, it is provided as the request body.

    - If [query_string] is specified, it is added to the URL after the [?] character.
      It is a list of key-value pairs.
      For instance, [~query_string: ["key1", "value1"; "key2", "value2"]]
      denotes [?key1=value1&key2=value2].

    - [path] is the part of the URL that denotes the RPC's endpoint.
      For instance, [["chains"; "main"; "blocks"; "head"]]
      denotes [/chains/main/blocks/head].

    - [decode] is the function that will be used to decode the response body of the RPC.
      If you do not want to define it, use [Fun.id] (to return a [JSON.t])
      or [ignore] (to ignore the response body).

    - [get_host] and [get_port] are callbacks to extract host and port from the
      endpoint to build the targeted url.

    Use one of the [call] functions below to actually call the RPC. *)
val make :
  ?data:JSON.u ->
  ?query_string:(string * string) list ->
  get_host:('endpoint -> string) ->
  get_port:('endpoint -> int) ->
  verb ->
  string list ->
  (JSON.t -> 'result) ->
  ('endpoint, 'result) t

(** Parse and decode a response body using the decode function of an RPC description.

    [origin] is used in error messages.
    Its default value is ["RPC response"]. *)
val decode_raw : ?origin:string -> ('endpoint, 'result) t -> string -> 'result

(** Decode a response body using the decode function of an RPC description. *)
val decode : ('endpoint, 'result) t -> JSON.t -> 'result

  body : 'a;  (** Response body. *)
  code : int;  (** Status code (e.g. 200 for OK, 404 for Not Found). *)
}

(** Call an RPC.

    The response body is parsed as JSON, then decoded using the decode function
    of the RPC description.

    Calls [Test.fail] if the status code is not a success code.
    To handle error cases, use [call_raw] or [call_json] instead.
    They return the status code and you can use [decode] to parse the response body
    in case of success.

    If [log_request] is [true], log the HTTP method and URI before calling the RPC.
    Default is [true].

    If [log_response_status] is [true], log the HTTP status code of the response
    after the RPC call. Default is [true].

    If [log_response_body] is [true], log the response body after the RPC call.
    For [call] and [call_json], if the response is valid JSON, it is pretty-printed
    with indentation. Default is [true]. *)
