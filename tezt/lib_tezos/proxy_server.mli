          of this argument as a Boolean flag (not an argument) whether to pass
          [--data-dir] to [tezos-proxy-server]. *)

      (** Time interval (in seconds) during which data for a symbolic block
          identifier (like HEAD) is kept. A symbolic identifier
          is a block identifier that it not a hash and which hence
          cannot be safely used as a key in any form of cache. *)
