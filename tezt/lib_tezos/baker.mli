(** A baker instance *)
type t

(** Initialize a baker.

    This creates a baker, waits for it to be ready, and then returns it.

    As the baker usually relies on a node, we first
    wait for the node to be ready and then, run the baker.

    The path to the baker binary is chosen from the [protocol].

    The standard output and standard error output of the baker will
    be logged with prefix [name] and color [color].

    Default [event_pipe] is a temporary file whose name is derived
    from [name]. It will be created as a named pipe so that baker
    events can be received.

    The [Node.t] parameter is the node used by the baker. The baker
    is configured to use the node's data dir.

    The [Client.t] parameter is the client used by the baker. The baker
    is configured to use the client's base directory.

    If [runner] is specified, the baker will be spawned on this
    runner using SSH. *)
