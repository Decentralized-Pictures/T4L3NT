    argument.

    to a temporary file.

    Returns the path to the file that was written. *)
val liquidity_baking_votefile : ?path:string -> liquidity_baking_vote -> string

(** Create a baker.

    This function just creates a value of type [t], it does not call {!val:run}.

    The path to the baker binary is chosen from the [protocol].

    The standard output and standard error output of the baker will
    be logged with prefix [name] and color [color].

    Default [event_pipe] is a temporary file whose name is derived
    from [name]. It will be created as a named pipe so that baker
    events can be received.

    The [Node.t] parameter is the node used by the baker. The baker
    is configured to use the node's data dir.

    The [Client.t] parameter is the client used by the baker. The baker
    is configured to use the client's base directory.

    If [runner] is specified, the baker will be spawned on this
    runner using SSH.

    [delegates] is a list of account aliases (see {!val:Account.key.alias}), e.g.,
    bootstrap accounts (see {!val:Constant.bootstrap_keys}), delegated to this
    baker. This defaults to the empty list, which is a shortcut for "every known
    account".

    [votefile] and [liquidity_baking_toggle_vote] are passed to the baker daemon
    through the flags [--votefile] and [--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote]. If
    [--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote] is [None], then
    [--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote]
    is not passed. If it is [Some x] then [--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote x] is
    passed. The default value is [Some Pass]. *)

(** Initialize a baker.

    This creates a baker, waits for it to be ready, and then returns it.

    As the baker usually relies on a node, we first
    wait for the node to be ready and then, run the baker.

    be logged with prefix [name] and color [color].
