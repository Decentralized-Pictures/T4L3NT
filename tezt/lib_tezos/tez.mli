    Please note that none of the functions here perform any bounds checks. *)

(** A unit of tez *)
type t

(** Make [t] from the whole number of tez. This doesn't perform any bounds
    checks. *)
val of_int : int -> t

(** Make [t] from the whole number of micro tez. This doesn't perform any bounds
    checks. *)
val of_mutez_int : int -> t

(** Make [t] from the whole number of micro tez. This doesn't perform any bounds
    checks. *)
val of_mutez_int64 : int64 -> t

(** 0 tez *)
val zero : t

(** 1 tez *)
val one : t

(** Convert [t] to a string. *)
val to_string : t -> string

(** Convert [t] to a mutez integer. *)
val mutez_int64 : t -> int64

(** Convert [t] to a float of tez. *)
val to_float : t -> float

(** Convert [t] to an [int]. *)
val to_mutez : t -> int

(** Addition. This doesn't perform any bounds checks. *)
val ( + ) : t -> t -> t

(** Subtraction. This doesn't perform any bound checks. *)
val ( - ) : t -> t -> t

(** Parsing. Parse a floating point number of tez.

    Any string of digits followed by an optional point and another string
    of digits should parse successfully, provided that the expressed number
    is within bounds allowed for tez (up to 6 decimal places). For example:
    "123.4356" will parse, while
    "1.24723953794217492" won't, because it's too precise. *)
