(** Spawn Tezos nodes and control them. *)

(** Convention: in this module, some functions implement node commands;
    those functions are named after those commands.
    For instance, [Node.config_init] corresponds to [octez-node config init],
    and [Node.run] corresponds to [octez-node run].

    The arguments of those functions are also named after the actual arguments.
    For instance, [?network] is named after [--network], to make
    [Node.config_init ~network:"carthagenet"] look as close as possible
    to [octez-node config init --network carthagenet].

    Most options have default values which are not necessarily the default values
    of [octez-node]. Indeed, the latter are tailored for Mainnet, but here we
    use defaults which are tailored for the sandbox. In particular, the default
    value for [?network] is ["sandbox"].
    However, if you specify an option such as [~network] or [~history_mode],
    they are passed to the node unchanged, to reduce surprises.

    These conventions are also followed in the [Client] module. *)

(** History modes for the node. *)

(** The parameter for [Full] And [Rolling] mode is called [additional_cycles].

    For the [Full] (resp. [Rolling]) mode it controls the number of
    contexts (resp. blocks) we preserved behind the [checkpoint] (aka
    the no fork point). Default in sandbox mode is [2] and [5] for
    mainnet parameters (see [preserved_cycles] in the protocol
    parameters). *)
type history_mode = Archive | Full of int option | Rolling of int option

(** Values that can be passed to the node's [--media-type] argument *)
type media_type = Json | Binary | Any

(** Tezos node command-line arguments.

    Not all arguments are available here.
    Some are simply not implemented, and some are handled separately
    because they need special care. The latter are implemented as optional
    labeled arguments (e.g. [?net_port] and [?data_dir]). *)
type argument =
  | Network of string  (** [--network] *)
  | History_mode of history_mode  (** [--history-mode] *)

type t

(** Create a node.

    This function just creates the [t] value, it does not call
    [identity_generate] nor [config_init] nor [run].

    The standard output and standard error output of the node will
    be logged with prefix [name] and color [color].

    Default [data_dir] is a temporary directory
    which is always the same for each [name].

    Default [event_pipe] is a temporary file
    whose name is derived from [name]. It will be created
    as a named pipe so that node events can be received.

    Default values for [net_port] or [rpc_port] are chosen automatically
    with values starting from 16384 (configurable with `--starting-port`).
    They are used by [config_init]
    and by functions from the [Client] module. They are not used by [run],
    so if you do not call [config_init] or generate the configuration file
    through some other means, your node will not listen.

    The argument list is a list of configuration options that the node
    should run with. It is passed to the first run of [octez-node config init].
    It is also passed to all runs of [octez-node run] that occur before
    [octez-node config init]. If [Expected_pow] is given, it is also used as
    the default value for {!identity_generate}.

    If [runner] is specified, the node will be spawned on this
    runner using SSH. *)

    the next [octez-node config init]. *)

(** Spawn [octez-node run].

    The resulting promise is fulfilled as soon as the node has been spawned.
    It continues running in the background.

    [event_level] specifies the verbosity of the file descriptor sink.
    This must be at least [`Notice], which is the level of event
    ["node_is_ready.v0"], needed for {!wait_for_ready}.
    The default value is [`Info] which is also the default event level
    of the node.

    [event_sections_levels] specifies the verbosity for events in sections whose
    prefix is in the list. For instance
    [~event_sections_levels:[("prevalidator", `Debug); ("validator.block", `Debug)]]
    will activate the logs at debug level for events whose section starts with
    ["prevalidator"] or ["validator.block"].
    See {!Tezos_stdlib_unix.File_descriptor_sink} and

(** Initialize a node.

    This {!create}s a node, runs {!identity_generate}, {!config_init} and {!run},
    then waits for the node to be ready, and finally returns the node.

    Arguments are passed to {!config_init}. If you specified [Expected_pow],
    it is also passed to {!identity_generate}. Arguments are not passed to {!run}.
    If you do not wish the arguments to be stored in the configuration file
    (which will affect future runs too), do not use [init].

    When [patch_config] is provided, the function is used to patch the
    configuration file generated by {!config_init} before the call to
    {!run}. This argument should only be used to test configuration
    options that cannot be set with command-line {!argument}s.

    To import a snapshot before calling {!run}, specify
    [~snapshot:(file, do_reconstruct)], where file is the path to the snapshot.
    If [reconstruct] is [true], then [--reconstruct] is passed to the import
    command.
