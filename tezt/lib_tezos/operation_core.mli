(** This module can be used to craft an operation without using client
   dedicated commands.

    {1 Overview}

    This module aims to replace the module {!module:Operation_legacy}
   to provide an interface which is more extensible. In other words,
   supporting a new operation should be easier using this interface.

    An unsigned operation is represented by the datatype
   {!type:t}. {!type:t} is a wrapper around a JSON representation of
   an operation. Some meta information needs to be provided to sign
   this operation. {!type:t} is not signed a priori to ease writing
   tests with bad signatures.

    This module also provides two functions to ease the injection of
   an operation: {!val:inject} which should be called when the
   injection is expected to succeed, and {!val:inject_with_error} when
   the injection is expected to fail.

    Anyone is free to add support for new operations.


    {2 Manager operations}

    Manager operations represent most of the operations used by the
   tests. Those operations contain several parameters (see
   {!val:Manager.make}) and can be batched. Wrapper like
   {!val:Manager.inject} and {!val:Manager.inject_with_error} are
   provided to ease the writing of tests.

*)

(** The abstract representation of an unsigned operation. *)
type t

type operation := t

(** The kind is necessary because it determines the watermark of an
   operation which is necessary for signing an operation. This type
   aims to be extended when other kinds of operations are added into
   this module. *)
type kind = Consensus of {chain_id : string} | Voting | Manager

(** [make ~branch ~signer ~kind json client] builds the representation
   of an unsigned operation. *)
val make : branch:string -> signer:Account.key -> kind:kind -> JSON.u -> t

(** [json t] gives the json representation of an unsigned operation. *)
val json : t -> JSON.u

(** [hex ?(signature=None) t client] computes the binary
   representation of an operation as an hexadecimal string. If
   [signature] is given, the hexadecimal represents the signed
   version of the operation. [client] is used to construct the binary
   representation of [t].

   @param signature controls whether a signature should be attached
   to the operation. *)
val hex : ?signature:Tezos_crypto.Signature.t -> t -> Client.t -> Hex.t Lwt.t

(** [sign t client] signs the raw representation of operation [t] by
   its signer (see {!val:make}). [client] is used to construct the
   binary representation of [t]. *)
val sign : t -> Client.t -> Tezos_crypto.Signature.t Lwt.t

(** [inject ?(request=`Inject) ?(force=false) ?(signature=None)
   ?(error=None) t] injects an operation into the node. The node is
   extracted from the [Client]. If a node cannot be extracted, the
   injection fails. If the injection succeeds, the hash of the
   operation is returned.

   @param request If [`Inject], we do not wait the [prevalidator] to
   classify the operation. This can create some flakyness in the test
   but is needed to test corner cases. If [`Notify], the function
   waits for the prevalidator to classify the operation. However, the
   nodes need to activate the debug events for the prevalidator.

   @param force If [true], the function succeeds even though the
   operation was classified with an error and was not propagated by
   the prevalidator. If [false], the call fails if the prevalidator
   classified the operation with an error.

   @param signature Allows to give manually the signature of the
   operation. The operation is signed when the signature is omitted.

   @param error If the injection is expecting to fail, allows to
   specify the expected error.  *)
val inject :
  ?request:[`Inject | `Notify] ->
  ?force:bool ->
  ?signature:Tezos_crypto.Signature.t ->
  ?error:rex ->
  t ->
  Client.t ->
  [`OpHash of string] Lwt.t

(** [inject_operations] is similar as [inject] for a list of
   operations. This function calls the RPC
   {!val:RPC.post_private_injection_operations} which is faster than
   calling the RPC used by {!val:inject} several times. Note that this
   function should be used mainly when the time for injecting
   operations matters. *)
val inject_operations :
  ?request:[`Inject | `Notify] ->
  ?force:bool ->
  ?error:rex ->
  t list ->
  Client.t ->
  [`OpHash of string] list Lwt.t

(** Craft a json representing the full operation, in a format that is
   compatible with the [run_operation] RPC
   ({!RPC.post_chain_block_helpers_scripts_run_operation}).

   This json contains many more fields than the one produced by the
   {!json} function above.

   The operation is signed with {!Tezos_crypto.Signature.zero},
   because the [run_operation] RPC skips signature checks anyway.

   @param chain_id Allows to manually provide the [chain_id]. If
   omitted, the [chain_id] is retrieved via RPC using the provided
   [client].

   @param client The {!Client.t} argument is used to retrieve the
   [chain_id] when it is not provided. *)
val make_run_operation_input : ?chain_id:string -> t -> Client.t -> JSON.u Lwt.t

module Consensus : sig
  (** A representation of a consensus operation. *)
  type t

  (** [slot_availability ~endorsement] crafts a data-availability
     consensus to endorse slot headers. For each slot, the value of
     the booleans indicates whether the data is available. *)
  val slot_availability : endorsement:bool array -> t

  (** [operation] constructs an operation from a consensus
     operation. the [client] is used to fetch the branch and the
     [chain_id]. *)
  val operation :
    ?branch:string ->
    ?chain_id:string ->
    signer:Account.key ->
    t ->
    Client.t ->
    operation Lwt.t

  (** A wrapper for {!val:inject} with consensus operations. The client
     is used to get all the data that was not provided if it can be
     recovered via RPCs. Mainly those are the [branch] and the
     [chain_id]. *)
  val inject :
    ?request:[`Inject | `Notify] ->

    t ->
    Client.t ->
    [`OpHash of string] Lwt.t

(** Voting operations (validation pass [1]): [proposals] and [ballot].

   Only the [proposals] operation is currently supported. Feel free to
   add support for [ballot] as needed. *)
module Voting : sig
  (** A representation of a voting operation. *)
  type t

  (** [proposals source period protocol_hashes] crafts a [proposals]
     operation, that is, an operation that submits candidate protocol
     hashes for voting.

     @param source The account that submits the proposals.

     @param period An index that identifies the targeted voting
     period.

     @params protocol_hashes A list of candidate protocol hashes. *)
  val proposals : Account.key -> int -> string list -> t

  (** Contruct a voting operation from its representation.

     @param branch Allows to manually provide the branch. If omitted,
     the branch it retrieved via RPC using the given client.

     @param client Used to retrieve the branch when it is not
     provided.

     @param signer Allows to manually set the signer of the operation,
     e.g. to craft an operation with a wrong signature. If omitted,
     the signer is the operation's source.

     @raise Invalid_argument if neither the [branch] argument nor the
     [client] one is provided. *)
  val operation :
    ?branch:string ->

  (** A wrapper for {!inject}ing a voting operation.

     See {!inject} for a description of arguments [request], [force],
     [signature], and [error].

     See [Voting.operation] right above for a description of arguments
     [branch] and [signer]. *)

  (** Payload of a manager operation. This excludes generic parameters
     common to all manager operations. See {!type:t}. *)
  type payload

  (** Build a public key revelation.

     The [Account.key] argument has no default value because it will
     typically be a fresh account. *)
  val reveal : Account.key -> payload

  (** [transfer ?(dest=Constant.bootstrap2) ~amount:1_000_000 ()]
     builds a transfer operation. Note that the amount is expressed in

  (** [call ~dest ~amount:0 ~entrypoint ~arg ()] builds a smart contract call

     availability layer slot with index [slot_index]. *)

  (** [delegation ?(delegate=Constant.bootstrap2) ()] builds a
     delegation operation. *)

     and should likely be generated by a PVM. We expose it as an Ezjsonm value. *)

  (** A section of a proof is make of a state hash, if any, and of a tick. *)
  type sc_rollup_dissection_chunk = {state_hash : string option; tick : int}

  (** A refutation step is either a dissection or a proof. *)

      refutation manager operation payload. The refutation is [None] in case
      of initialization or some game refutation step (either a dissection or
      a proof) otherwise. [sc_rollup] is the Sc rollup's address and [opponent] the
      public key hash of the staker who published the commitment we are about
