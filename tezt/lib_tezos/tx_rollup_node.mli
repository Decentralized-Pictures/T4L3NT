(** Wait for a custom event to occur.

      Usage: [wait_for_full daemon name filter]

      If an event named [name] occurs, apply [filter] to its
      whole json, which is of the form:
      {[{
        "fd-sink-item.v0": {
          "hostname": "...",
                      "time_stamp": ...,
                      "section": [ ... ],
                      "event": { <name>: ... }
                               }
        }]}
      If [filter] returns [None], continue waiting.
      If [filter] returns [Some x], return [x].

      [where] is used as the [where] field of the [Terminated_before_event] exception
      if the daemon terminates. It should describe the constraint that [filter] applies,
      such as ["field level exists"].

      It is advised to register such event handlers before starting the daemon,
      as if they occur before being registered, they will not trigger your handler.
      For instance, you can define a promise with
      [let x_event = wait_for daemon "x" (fun x -> Some x)]
      and bind it later with [let* x = x_event]. *)
val wait_for_full :
  ?where:string -> t -> string -> (JSON.t -> 'a option) -> 'a Lwt.t

(** Same as [wait_for_full] but ignore metadata from the file descriptor sink.

      More precisely, [filter] is applied to the value of field
      ["fd-sink-item.v0"."event".<name>].

      If the daemon receives a JSON value that does not match the right
      JSON structure, it is not given to [filter] and the event is
      ignored. See [wait_for_full] to know what the JSON value must
      look like. *)
val wait_for : ?where:string -> t -> string -> (JSON.t -> 'a option) -> 'a Lwt.t

(** Write the configuration file for a rollup node, overwriting when [force] is
    [true].  Returns the name of the configuration file. *)
