(** [manager_operation_content] is an abstract type for manager
   operations. Values of this type can be constructed using the smart
   constructors below.

    Unless mentioned otherwise, the default values for generic
   parameters of a manager operations are the following ones:

    - Default [counter] is the successor of the counter of [source].

    - Default [amount] is [1] tez.

    - Default [fee] is [1000] mutez.

    - Default [gas_limit] is [1040] gas. Use a greater limit
   (e.g. ~1500) if the destination is not allocated, and ~1900 if the
   source will additionnaly be emptied.

    - Default [storage_limit] is [257].  *)
type manager_operation_content

(** Michelson scripts and data in different representations.

    Used when originating or calling contracts.
    Depending on the test, the user can provide:

    - an EzJsonm value directly
    - a Michelson value in a string
    - a Michelson value in a file (mainly for Michelson scripts). In this
      case, files should have extension `.tz`, `.tez` or `.mic`
    - a file storing directly the JSON representation. This is for instance
      useful to test contracts that fail at type-checking. Instead of
      Michelson, the user can generate the JSON and store it a file with
      a '.json' extension.
