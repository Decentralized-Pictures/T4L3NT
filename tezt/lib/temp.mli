(** Temporary files for tests. *)

(** Main temporary directory, e.g. ["/tmp/tezt-1234"].

    Don't use it directly to create files, use [file] or [dir] instead.
    Use this value only in messages to users. *)
val main_dir : string

(** Get a temporary file name.

    For instance:
    - [file "hello.ml"] may return something like ["/tmp/tezt-1234/hello.ml"];
    - [file "some/dir/hello.ml"] may return ["/tmp/tezt-1234/some/dir/hello.ml"];
    - [file "/dir/hello.ml"] may return ["/tmp/tezt-1234/dir/hello.ml"].

    This function also creates the directory (and its parents) needed to host the
    resulting file.

    [perms] is the permissions for parent directories if they are created.
    Default is [0o755], i.e. [rwxr-xr-x].

    [file base] always returns the same result for a given [base]
    and for the same process. *)
val file : ?perms:Unix.file_perm -> string -> string

(** Get a temporary file name and create it as a directory. *)
val dir : ?perms:Unix.file_perm -> string -> string

(** Allow calls to [file] and [dir] until the next [clean_up].

    Calls to [file] and [dir] which are made before [start] result in an error.

    Don't call this directly, it is called by {!Test.run}.
    This prevents you from creating temporary files accidentally before your test
    actually runs. Indeed, if your test is disabled from the command-line it should
    not create temporary files. By using {!Test.run} you also ensure that {!clean_up}
    is called. *)
val start : unit -> unit

(** Delete temporary files and directories.

    All files which were returned by [file] are deleted.
    All directories which were returned by [dir] are deleted, but only if they
    did not already exist.
    All parent directories that were created are then deleted, but only if they are empty. *)
val clean_up : unit -> unit
