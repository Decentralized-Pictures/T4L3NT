       SELECTING TESTS\n\n\
      \  You can specify multiple tags, negated tags, titles and filenames on \
       the command line. Only tests which match all the following conditions \
       will be run:\n\
      \  - the test must have all tags and none of the negated tags;\n\
      \  - the test must have one of the specified titles;\n\
      \  - the test must be implemented in one of the specified files.\n\n\
      \  The tags of a test are given by the ~tags argument of Test.run. To \
       negate a tag, prefix it with a slash: /\n\n\
      \  The title of a test is given by the ~title argument of Test.run. It \
       is what is printed after [SUCCESS] (or [FAILURE] or [ABORTED]) in the \
       reports. Use --test to select a test by its title on the command-line.\n\n\
      \  The file in which a test is implemented is specified by the \
       ~__FILE__ argument of Test.run. In other words, it is the name of the \
       file in which the test is defined, without directories. Use --file to \
       select a test by its filename on the command-line.\n\n\
      \  For instance:\n\n\
      \    " ^ Sys.argv.(0)
    ^ " node bake /rpc --file bootstrap.ml --file sync.ml\n\n\
      \  will run all tests defined in either bootstrap.ml or sync.ml, which \
       have at least tags 'node' and 'bake', but which do not have the 'rpc' \
       tag.\n\n\
