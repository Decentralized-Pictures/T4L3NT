(** {2 Regular Expressions} *)

(** Compiled regular expressions. *)
type rex

(** Compile a regular expression using Perl syntax. *)

(** Test whether a string matches a regular expression.

    Example: ["number 1234 matches" =~ rex "\\d+"] *)

(** Match a regular expression with one capture group. *)

(** {2 Asynchronous Promises} *)

(** Register a promise so that [wait_for_async] handles it.

    It is important to use [async] instead of [Lwt.async] so that we wait for those
    promises to resolve (if only by being canceled) before moving on to other tests.

    Warning: if an [async] promise raises an exception other than [Test.Failed],
    it currently does not stop the test. You should probably not use [async], it
    is mostly for internal use. *)
val async : unit Lwt.t -> unit

(** Return a promise which resolves once all {!async}s have resolved. *)

(** Repeat something a given amount of times. *)

(* Open file, use function to write output then close the output. In case of
   error while writing, the channel is closed before raising the exception *)

(* Open file, use function to read input then close the input. In case of
   error while reading, the channel is closed before raising the exception *)
