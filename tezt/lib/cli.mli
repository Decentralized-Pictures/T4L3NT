(** Command-line interface. *)

(** Log levels for standard output.

    The list below is sorted from the most quiet level to the most verbose level.

    - Absolutely no log has log level [Quiet].
      In other words, setting log level [Quiet] inhibits all logs.

    - [Error] logs are about errors which imply that the current test failed.
      This includes messages given to [Test.fail] and uncaught exceptions.

    - [Warn] logs are about errors that do not cause the current test to fail.
      This includes failure to clean up temporary files, for instance.

    - [Report] logs are informational messages that report the result of the current test.
      They tell the user whether the test was successful or not.
      They may also include information about how to re-run the test.

    - [Info] logs are informational messages that summarize what the test is doing.
      They tell the user that a particular milestone was reached.
      In tests, it is a good idea to log [Info] messages at significant checkpoints.

    - [Debug] logs give more details about exactly what is happening.
      They include external process outputs, exit codes, and signals which are sent.

    Additionally, some flags such as [--commands] and [--list] cause some information
    to be printed unconditionally, even with [--quiet]. Such kind of output is not
    considered to be log messages. *)
type log_level = Quiet | Error | Warn | Report | Info | Debug

(** What to do with temporary files after the test is finished. *)
type temporary_file_mode = Delete | Delete_if_successful | Keep

(** How many times to loop. *)
type loop_mode = Infinite | Count of int

(** Command-line options.

    [log_file] is [Some channel] where [channel] is open on [filename]
    if [--log-file filename] was specified on the command line.
    [channel] is automatically replaced by another channel if {!init}
    is called again with [--log-file]. [channel] is automatically closed
    either when replaced by another one or at exit. *)

  mutable color : bool;
  mutable log_level : log_level;

(** Values for command-line options. *)
val options : options

(** Read command-line options to initialize [options].

    By default arguments are read from [Sys.argv], but you can specify [args]
    to override this behavior. Note that [args] must not contain the executable
    name ([Sys.argv.(0)]), only actual arguments.

    If you do not call [init], [options] will contain only default values.

    [init] exits the program on failure to parse the arguments (with code 2) or
    when either [-help] or [--help] is present (with code 0).

    Warning: if [--log-file] is specified, the file is truncated.
    So if you call [init] several times with the same [--log-file] argument,
    all logs between the calls to [init] are lost in this file. *)
