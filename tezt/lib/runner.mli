(** Create a runner.

    This function does not start any SSH connection, it only stores
    SSH connection information in a record.

    - [ssh_alias] is the alias in the ssh config file.
    - [ssh_user] is the username on the remote machine.
    - [ssh_port] is the port on the remote machine.
    - [ssh_id] is the path to the identity file.
    - [address] is the IP address of the remote machine. *)

(** Get the IP address of the local machine as perceived by other runners.

    Use this if you need a runner to reach a process that is running on the
    local machine.

    This returns ["127.0.0.1"] by default, but you can set it with
    {!set_local_public_ip}. *)
val get_local_public_ip : unit -> string

(** Set the IP address of the local machine as perceived by other runners. *)
val set_local_public_ip : string -> unit

(** Get the IP / DNS address of a runner.

    Usage: [address ~from runner]

    Return the address at which a source node [from] can contact [runner].

    If the source node [from] is not specified, return the [address] of [runner]
    as given to {!create}. If [runner] itself is [None], return ["127.0.0.1"]
    or ["localhost"] if the [hostname] variable is set to true (default false).

    If [from] is specified:
    - if [runner] is [None], return [get_local_public_ip ()];
    - if [from] and [runner] are the same runner, return ["127.0.0.1"];
    - else, return the [address] of [runner]. *)

module Shell : sig
  (** Shell command representation.

      This module is used for the subset of the shell language that is
      needed to operate remote runners through SSH. It makes sure that
      shell command are properly quoted. *)

  (** Commands.

      Commands execute a program (whose executable name is [name]),
      with some [arguments], possibly with some specific environment
      variables [local_env] to add to the current environment.  *)
  type command = {
    local_env : (string * string) list;
    name : string;
    arguments : string list;

  (** Shell programs. *)
  type t =
    | Cmd of command  (** run a command *)
    | Seq of t * t  (** run something, then something else ([;]) *)
    | Echo_pid  (** echo the current process PID ([echo $$]) *)
    | Redirect_stdout of t * string  (** redirect stdout to a file ([>]) *)
    | Redirect_stderr of t * string  (** redirect stderr to a file ([2>]) *)
    | Or_echo_false of t
        (** run something, if it fails, print "false" ([|| echo false]) *)

  (** Convert a shell program into a string.

      The result is quoted using shell syntax.

      [context] specifies whether parentheses are needed:
      - [`top] means no parentheses are needed (default);
      - [`operator] means parentheses may be needed because this command is
        inside of an operator such as [;] or [||]. *)
  val to_string : ?context:[`operator | `top] -> t -> string

  (** Make a command to execute a program.

      Usage: [cmd local_env name arguments]

      Same as: [Cmd { local_env; name; arguments }] *)
  val cmd : (string * string) list -> string -> string list -> t

  (** Make a sequence.

      Usage: [seq command_1 command_2]

      Same as: [Seq (command_1, command_2)] *)
  val seq : t -> t -> t

  (** Make an stdout redirection.

      Usage: [redirect_stdout command path]

      Same as: [Redirect_stdout (command, path)] *)
  val redirect_stdout : t -> string -> t

  (** Make an stderr redirection.

      Usage: [redirect_stderr command path]

      Same as: [Redirect_stderr (command, path)] *)
  val redirect_stderr : t -> string -> t

  (** Make a shell program that prints "false" if another program fails.

      Usage: [or_echo_false command]

      Same as: [Or_echo_false command] *)
  val or_echo_false : t -> t
end

(** Wrap a shell command into an SSH call.

    Usage: [wrap_with_ssh runner shell]

    Return [(name, arguments)] where [name] is ["ssh"] and [arguments]
    are arguments to pass to SSH to execute [shell] on [runner]. *)
val wrap_with_ssh : t -> Shell.t -> string * string list

(** Same as {!wrap_with_ssh}, but print the PID on stdout first.

    The PID can be used later on to, for instance, kill the remote process.
    Indeed, killing the local SSH process will not necessarily kill
    the remote process. *)
val wrap_with_ssh_pid : t -> Shell.command -> string * string list

module Sys : sig
  (** Extension to [Stdlib.Sys] that can also execute on remote runners.

      Most functions from this module just call their [Stdlib.Sys] equivalent
      when [runner] is not specified. When [runner] is specified, they
      instead use SSH to execute a shell command remotely with a similar effect. *)

  (** Errors that can occur when executing a [Sys] command on a remote runner. *)
  type error

  (** Exception raised when failing to execute a [Sys] command remotely.

      This is not raised when running a command without a [runner].
      Instead, [Sys_error] is raised. *)
  exception Remote_error of error

  (** Convert an error to an error message. *)
  val show_error : error -> string

  (** Check if a file exists on the system.

      For the local version, see {{: https://ocaml.org/api/Sys.html} Sys.file_exists}. *)
  val file_exists : ?runner:t -> string -> bool

  (** Create a new directory.

      For the local version, see {{: https://ocaml.org/api/Unix.html} Unix.mkdir}. *)
  val mkdir : ?runner:t -> ?perms:int -> string -> unit

  (** Check if a file exists and is a directory.

      For the local version, see {{: https://ocaml.org/api/Sys.html} Sys.is_directory}. *)
  val is_directory : ?runner:t -> string -> bool

  (** Return the contents of a directory.

      For the local version, see {{: https://ocaml.org/api/Sys.html} Sys.readdir}. *)
  val readdir : ?runner:t -> string -> string array

  (** Remove a file.

      For the local version, see {{: https://ocaml.org/api/Sys.html} Sys.remove}. *)
  val remove : ?runner:t -> string -> unit

  (** Remove recursively with [rm -rf].

      Only implemented for remote runners. *)
  val rm_rf : t -> string -> unit

  (** Remove a directory.

      For the local version, see {{: https://ocaml.org/api/Unix.html} Unix.rmdir}. *)
  val rmdir : ?runner:t -> string -> unit

  (** Create a named pipe.
