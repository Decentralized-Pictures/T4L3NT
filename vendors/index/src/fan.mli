type t

val equal : t -> t -> bool
(** The equality function for fan-out. *)

val v : hash_size:int -> entry_size:int -> int -> t
(** [v ~hash_size ~entry_size n] creates a fan_out for an index with [hash_size]
    and [entry_size], containing [n] elements. *)

val nb_fans : t -> int
(** [nb_fans t] is the number of fans in [t]. *)

val search : t -> int -> int64 * int64
(** [search t hash] is the interval of offsets in witch [hash] is, if
    present. *)

val update : t -> int -> int64 -> unit
(** [update t hash off] updates [t] so that [hash] is registered to be at
    offset [off]. *)

val finalize : t -> unit
(** Finalizes the update of the fanout. This is mendatory before any [search]
    query. *)

val exported_size : t -> int
(** [exported_size t] is the size of [export t]. This does not actually
    compute the encoding of [t]. *)

val export : t -> string
(** [export t] is a string encoded form of [t]. *)

val import : hash_size:int -> string -> t
(** [import ~hash_size buf] decodes [buf] such that
    [import ~hash_size (export t) = t] if [t] was initially created with
    ~hash_size. *)
