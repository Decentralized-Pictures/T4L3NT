(** Index

    [Index] is a scalable implementation of persistent indices in OCaml.

    [Index] provides the standard key-value interface: [find], [mem] and
    [replace]. It requires three IO instances:

    - A `log` IO containing all of the recently-added bindings; this is also
      kept in memory.

    - When the `log` IO is full, it is merged into the `index` IO. Search is
      done first in `log` then in `index`, which makes recently added bindings
      search faster.

    - A `lock` IO to ensure safe concurrent access. *)

(** The input of [Make] for keys. *)
module type Key = sig
  type t
  (** The type for keys. *)

  val equal : t -> t -> bool
  (** The equality function for keys. *)

  val hash : t -> int
  (** Note: Unevenly distributed hash functions may result in performance
      drops. *)

  val hash_size : int
  (** The number of bits necessary to encode the maximum output value of
      {!hash}. `Hashtbl.hash` uses 30 bits.

      Overestimating the [hash_size] will result in performance drops;
      underestimation will result in undefined behavior. *)

  val encode : t -> string
  (** [encode] is an encoding function. The resultant encoded values must have
      size {!encoded_size}. *)

  val encoded_size : int
  (** [encoded_size] is the size of the result of {!encode}, expressed in
      number of bytes. *)

  val decode : string -> int -> t
  (** [decode s off] is the decoded form of the encoded value at the offset
      [off] of string [s]. Must satisfy [decode (encode t) 0 = t]. *)

  val pp : t Fmt.t
  (** Formatter for keys *)
end

    purposes. *)

      @param read_only whether read-only mode is enabled for this index.
      @param log_size the maximum number of bindings in the `log` IO. *)

  val clear : t -> unit
  (** [clear t] clears [t] so that there are no more bindings in it. *)

  val find : t -> key -> value
  (** [find t k] is the binding of [k] in [t]. *)

  val mem : t -> key -> bool
  (** [mem t k] is [true] iff [k] is bound in [t]. *)

  exception Invalid_key_size of key

  exception Invalid_value_size of value

      size than encoded_size *)

  val replace : t -> key -> value -> unit
  (** [replace t k v] binds [k] to [v] in [t], replacing any existing binding
      of [k]. *)

  val iter : (key -> value -> unit) -> t -> unit
  (** Iterates over the index bindings. Order is not specified. In case of
      recent replacements of existing values (after the last merge), this will
      hit both the new and old bindings. *)
