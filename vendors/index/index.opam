synopsis: "A platform-agnostic multi-level index for OCaml"
description:"""
Index is a scalable implementation of persistent indices in OCaml.

It takes an arbitrary IO implementation and user-supplied content
types and supplies a standard key-value interface for persistent
storage. Index provides instance sharing by default: each OCaml
run-time shares a common singleton instance.

Index supports multiple-reader/single-writer access. Concurrent access
is safely managed using lock files."""
