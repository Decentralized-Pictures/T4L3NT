type secp256r1
(** Kinds of ECC curves. *)

type _ t
(** Type of an ECC curve, parametrized by its kind. *)

val secp256r1 : secp256r1 t
(** Supported curves. *)

val sk_size : int
(** [sk_size curve] is the size in bytes of secret keys from
    [curve]. Typically the same as the curve size, (i.e. 32 bytes for
    [secp256r1]) except for [secp160r1] which is 21 bytes. *)

val pk_size : int
(** [pk_size curve] is the size in bytes of public keys from
    [curve]. Equals to [2*curve_size]. *)

val compressed_size : int
(** [compressed_size curve] is the size in bytes of compressed public
    keys from [curve]. Equals to [pk_size curve/2+1]. *)

type secret
type public
type _ key
(** Type of a key, parametrized by its curve and kind. *)

val equal : 'a key -> 'a key -> bool
(** [equal k1 k2] is [true] if [k1] is represented by the same bytes
    as [k2], and [false] otherwise. *)

val neuterize : 'a key -> public key
(** [neuterize k] is [k] if [k] is public, or is the associated public
    key of [k] if [k] is secret. *)

val sk_of_bytes :
  Bytes.t -> (secret key * public key) option
(** [sk_of_bytes curve buf] is [Some (sk, pk)] if [buf] contains a
    valid serialization of a [curve] secret key, or [None] otherwise. *)

val pk_of_bytes : Bytes.t -> (public key) option
(** [pk_of_bytes curve buf] is [Some pk] if [buf] contains a valid
    serialization of a [curve] public key, or [None] otherwise. *)

val to_bytes : ?compress:bool -> _ key -> Bytes.t
(** [to_bytes ?compress k] is a serialization of [k]. If [compress] is
    [true] (the default) and [k] is a public key, the public key will
    be in compressed format. *)

val write_key : ?compress:bool -> Bytes.t -> _ key -> int
(** [write_key buf k] writes [k] at [buf] and returns the number of
    bytes actually written. *)

val keypair : unit -> (secret key * public key) option
(** [keypair curve] is [Some (sk, pk)] where [sk] and [pk] is freshly
    generated keypair for [curve] if everything went well, or [None]
    otherwise. *)

val sign : secret key -> Bytes.t -> Bytes.t option
(** [sign sk msg] is [Some signature] where [signature] is a valid
    signature of [msg] with secret key [sk], or [None] if an error
    occurred. *)

val write_sign :
  secret key -> Bytes.t -> msg:Bytes.t -> int
(** [write_sign sk ~msg buf] writes a signature of [msg] with [sk] to
    [buf], and returns the number of bytes written (0 in the case of an
    error). *)

val verify :
  public key -> msg:Bytes.t -> signature:Bytes.t -> bool
(** [verify pk ~msg ~signature] is [true] if [signature] is a valid
    signature of [msg] corresponding to [pk]. *)
